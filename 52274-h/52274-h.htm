<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages contain the
substance of some Sermons preached in the course of my parochial
ministry, on the subject of Sanctification, and are published at
the request of several members of my congregation.</p>
<p>They contain nothing new, and, being parochial sermons, they
are not in the form of a systematic treatise.&nbsp; But I hope
they exhibit the doctrine of Sanctification as revealed in
Scripture, as embodied in the teaching of the Church of England,
and as preached by those who are generally termed the Evangelical
Clergy.</p>
<p>They are not so much controversial as practical.&nbsp; <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>My desire has
not been to discuss new opinions, but to bring out old
truths.&nbsp; I shall be truly thankful if this shall prove to
have been done; and I commit them to God, with the earnest prayer
that He may make them useful, by the power of the Holy Spirit, to
those who long for the fulfilment of the prayer of their most
blessed Saviour,&mdash;&lsquo;Sanctify them through Thy truth,
Thy Word is truth.&rsquo;</p>

1</span>SEPARATION UNTO GOD.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Elect according to the foreknowledge of God
the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience
and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ; Grace unto you, and
peace, be multiplied.&rsquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Pet</span>. i. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is one of the encouraging features of the present day that
many of the Lord&rsquo;s people are aiming at a higher standard
of Christian holiness than they have ever yet known, and are
looking to the great grace of their most blessed Saviour to raise
them by His Spirit above the various hindrances which have
hitherto impeded their progress.&nbsp; They desire that there
should be no impediment in the service of their blessed
Saviour.&nbsp; In their worship they would draw very near to Him,
and in their life they would glorify His name.&nbsp; But yet,
when they seek to do so, and when they fairly look at God&rsquo;s
character, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>God&rsquo;s claims, God&rsquo;s will, and God&rsquo;s
glory, they find reason to be humbled to the dust; and the more
they realize His infinite mercy in Christ Jesus, the more they
learn of the magnitude and multitude of their own
shortcomings.&nbsp; Thus it sometimes comes to pass that in many
true believers their greatest discouragements are intimately
connected with their efforts after holiness, and many of their
doubts and difficulties arise from their real desire for true
sanctification.&nbsp; The more that they aim at the holiness of
God, the more they feel their sin, and the more earnestly that
they strive to rise, the more keenly do they feel the pain and
humiliation of the ruin of their fallen nature.&nbsp; It is
important therefore for those who desire holiness to look
carefully into the teaching of Scripture on the great subject of
Sanctification; to examine what is really promised, and to learn
what the Word of God teaches us to expect.&nbsp; Does it, or does
it not, make provision for such difficulties?&nbsp; And if it
does, what is the provision?&nbsp; These are some of the
questions which I desire now to consider, and I hope it may
please God to fulfil to both writer and reader the prayer of the
Apostle: &lsquo;The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>blameless unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now one of the great difficulties of the subject is, that in
all languages certain words are employed to express more than one
idea, and that the idea connected with the word often changes as
time advances.&nbsp; To a certain extent this applies to the word
&lsquo;sanctification&rsquo; in sacred Scripture.&nbsp; It has no
less than four distinct meanings in the Word of God; and, if we
treat them all as if they were the same, we are sure to be
confused.&nbsp; It has its original sense, and three others that
have grown out of it.&nbsp; The original sense is separation unto
God, or dedication; and the three that have grown out of it are
legal cleansing, personal holiness, and the exaltation of the
holiness of God.&nbsp; If therefore we wish to understand the
teaching of Scripture, we must clearly examine the use of the
word in these four senses.&nbsp; May the Lord Himself help us to
do so!</p>
<p>If we turn then to the beginning, we shall find that the
original sense of the word &lsquo;to sanctify&rsquo; is to set
apart unto God.</p>
<p>So in the Old Testament the Hebrew is frequently rendered
&lsquo;to hallow,&rsquo; or to set apart as a holy thing.</p>
<p>In this sense it is used of the Sabbath (Gen. <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>ii. 3):
&lsquo;God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He separated it from the ordinary purposes of
common life, and set it apart as a day peculiar to Himself.&nbsp;
So again the first-born were set apart unto God, and therefore
said to be sanctified; as we read, Exod. xiii. 2: &lsquo;Sanctify
unto Me all the first-born&mdash;both of man and of beast: it is
mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; So of the Temple, God said (2 Chron. vii. 16),
&lsquo;I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may
be there for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same is said of the priests,
the vessels of the sanctuary, and the lamb taken from the flock
for sacrifice: they were all separated unto God, and thus said to
be sanctified.&nbsp; It is in this sense that our blessed Saviour
made use of the word, when He said in John, xvii. 19, &lsquo;For
their sakes I sanctify myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; No one can suppose
for one moment that He made Himself more holy, or cleansed
Himself from actual sin, for He had been from all eternity holy,
harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.&nbsp; There was
no possibility of any increase of holiness in Him.&nbsp; But He
did, from the deep love that filled His heart, set Himself apart
unto God, to be the one perfect sin-offering for man.&nbsp; As
the lamb was sanctified when it was taken from the flock, and set
apart for sacrifice, so did He sanctify Himself <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>when He
separated Himself from all human fellowship, and, as one set
apart unto God, bore alone the whole burden of human guilt.</p>
<p>Now, this is the sense in which the word is used whenever
sanctification is spoken of as something past, or complete.&nbsp;
There are passages in which it is described as the past act of
God, as, <i>e.g.</i> Jude, 1, where God&rsquo;s people are spoken
of as being, or having been, &lsquo;sanctified by God the
Father;&rsquo; and 2 Thess. ii. 13, where they are described as
having been &lsquo;chosen to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason is,
that they have already been set apart by the Holy Ghost as a
peculiar people unto God.&nbsp; They have been like a branch of
the wild olive, cut out from the old tree, and engrafted into the
new.&nbsp; That grafting into Christ involved a separation, for
it implied a cutting out as well as a grafting in; and therefore,
whenever a soul has been incorporated into Christ, there has been
in this sense an act of sanctification, or, in other words, of
separation unto God.&nbsp; Such passages do not refer to personal
holiness; but to the past act of God in separating His elect unto
Himself.&nbsp; I have no doubt that this is the meaning of the
text.&nbsp; We <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>all know that the work of holiness is the consequence of
the gift of pardon.&nbsp; It is not till we are forgiven through
the great blood-sprinkling that the real work of holiness
begins.&nbsp; But in these words sanctification comes before it,
and the sprinkling of the blood is described as the result of the
sanctifying act.&nbsp; The reason is, not that this verse is at
variance with the rest of Scripture,&mdash;God forbid the
thought,&mdash;but that the word sanctification does not here
express our growth in personal holiness, but means God&rsquo;s
great act of separation unto Himself by the mighty power of the
Holy Ghost.&nbsp; As the Sabbath was set apart unto God, so have
we been set apart if we be in Christ Jesus: and it is both our
privilege and duty to regard ourselves as chosen out of the world
and now belonging, as a peculiar people, unto God.&nbsp; It is
with reference to this act of separation that the Apostle
addresses God&rsquo;s people in the words, &lsquo;Elect according
to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of
the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ: Grace unto you, and peace be multiplied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If we take the word in this sense the passage <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>will throw a
flood of light on three important subjects: the origin of this
separation, its result, and the power by which it is
accomplished.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; Its <span class="smcap">Origin</span>.&nbsp; This is
very clearly the electing love of God.&nbsp; The sanctification,
or separation here described, is the application of God&rsquo;s
electing love to the individual.&nbsp; Our Lord says (John, x.
16) of us Gentiles, &lsquo;Other sheep I have, which are not of
this fold: them also I must bring.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the loving
purpose of God they were His when He spoke; but they were at that
time either not yet born, or still living in heathenism, He said,
&lsquo;Them also I must bring.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other words, those
who were His by the eternal covenant He must in due time separate
unto Himself; and that separation, or that bringing, is the
sanctification here described.&nbsp; It is that great act of God
in which He carries into effect, or applies, His own eternal
purpose.</p>
<p>And think what a stability this gives to the work!&nbsp; If it
were the result of our own will it must be liable to all the
failures inseparable from the weakness of our will; but as it is
the carrying out of His own eternal purpose, it is unchangeable,
because it is divine.&nbsp; Man-made conversions <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>soon fall to
pieces; but when God calls and separates His own elect, it is for
ever.&nbsp; He incorporates them into Christ, and they are one
with Him for all eternity.</p>
<p>Ah, brethren, if you be in Him, you may be exposed to many,
and strong temptations; you may be obliged to tread in slippery
places, and find your feet very weak under their burden; but in
the midst of it all you may rely, not merely on daily mercy, but
also on everlasting love; and may take courage in the assurance
that, as He changeth not, so you will be kept by His power
through faith unto salvation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; The passage teaches us also the <span
class="smcap">Result</span>.&nbsp; This great result is
conversion, as taught us in the words, &lsquo;unto obedience, and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can
scarcely imagine a better description of the character and
blessings of conversion than that contained in these words, for
they present it to us in a double aspect,&mdash;on the one hand
surrender, and on the other pardon.</p>
<p>Surrender.&nbsp; This is the meaning of obedience, in the
passage.&nbsp; It must not be confounded with the holy and loving
obedience of the child of <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>God walking in his Father&rsquo;s
footsteps, for it is rather the surrender of the once rebellious
heart when it receives Christ as its Saviour and King.&nbsp; It
is the obedience described in Acts, vi. 7, where it is said that
&lsquo;a great company of the priests were obedient to the
faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the faith to which they were obedient:
not the law.&nbsp; They received the message of life, and yielded
themselves unto the Lord.&nbsp; It is the obedience of Saul of
Tarsus, when, having hated, opposed, and persecuted, he gave up
in complete surrender, and said, &lsquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have
me to do?&rsquo;&nbsp; And here lies the great difficulty with a
great number.&nbsp; If there be the true separation unto God,
there must be surrender, for it is a sanctification unto
obedience; and there is no denying that the heart oftentimes
recoils from it.&nbsp; Oh, how near have some come,&mdash;how
beautifully near! almost like the young man whom Jesus
loved.&nbsp; But that young man went back after all.&nbsp; He
went away very sorrowful; but still he went.&nbsp; I hope you may
not do the same!&nbsp; But I stand in doubt of some of you, for
though almost, you are not yet altogether: though near, you are
not within; though earnest, not yet safe.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
There is no submission: you cannot give up.&nbsp; There <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>are old
prejudices, old thoughts, old likes and dislikes, old
confidences; and you cannot make up your mind to give all up, and
to surrender your whole soul into the hands of your Lord and
Saviour.</p>
<p>Yet think what a blessing there is connected with such
surrender: nothing less than &lsquo;the sprinkling of the blood
of Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; That sprinkling is the personal
application of the great atonement to the individual soul.&nbsp;
The shedding of the blood was a public act, which might or might
not be effectual to individuals; but the sprinkling of it is
altogether a personal matter.&nbsp; It is the application to the
individual of the great atonement made for every man.&nbsp; So
that those who are thus sanctified, or set apart unto God, are
set apart unto the sacred privilege of having their sins blotted
out for ever; and those who have been brought by the Holy Ghost
to the obedience of the faith, are in their own souls sprinkled
with the blood of Christ.&nbsp; Not only do they know that there
is a fountain open for sin and for uncleanness, but they
themselves are cleansed by it, and walk before God in the sacred
peace of full forgiveness and perfect love.</p>
<p>Oh, how is it that there can be any backwardness <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>in thus
surrendering to Christ!&nbsp; Do you not thirst for that sacred
fellowship?&nbsp; Do you not long to be able to say, &lsquo;Who
hath washed me from my sins in His own blood?&rsquo;&nbsp; Is
there any blessedness to be compared to that of having sin
blotted out for ever?&nbsp; Why, then, do you still hold
back?&nbsp; Why not give up, and just cast yourself, ruined and
helpless, into the arms of your Saviour, that His own most
precious blood may be sprinkled on your soul, and that by His
great grace you may be His, and His for ever?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; But we must hasten to our last subject: the <span
class="smcap">Author</span> of this most blessed change.&nbsp;
This is distinctly said to be the Spirit.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
sanctification of the Spirit,&rsquo; as in 2 Thess. ii. 14.</p>
<p>Observe, in passing, how all the three persons of the Holy
Trinity appear in the verse.&nbsp; There is the foreknowledge of
God the Father, the sprinkling of the blood of the Son, and the
sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>It is from such passages as these that the answer in the
Church Catechism is derived: &lsquo;I believe in God the Holy
Ghost, who sanctifieth me, and all the elect people of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>branch or department of
sanctification is His work.&nbsp; The original call, the
progressive struggle, and the final victory, are all alike by His
power.&nbsp; It was when the Holy Ghost descended at Pentecost
that &lsquo;the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be
saved;&rsquo; and it is just in proportion as the same Holy Ghost
puts forth His power now that souls are separated unto God.&nbsp;
There is no real sanctification of any kind whatever unless it be
the sanctification of the Spirit.&nbsp; If it is brought about by
religious machinery, or any inferior agency, it is not the real
thing, and will never lead to the real result.&nbsp; I am most
anxious to press this upon you, for I think there is great danger
of Christian people losing sight of it.&nbsp; Some people seem to
think that everything depends on certain men or certain plans:
but you cannot save souls by planning.&nbsp; We cannot bear this
in mind too strongly with reference to those missions and mission
preachers which are now exciting the deep interest of
multitudes.&nbsp; I attach a very high value to those mission
efforts: I have engaged in them myself, and I believe the Holy
Ghost gave His blessing.&nbsp; But it is not a mission week, nor
a mission preacher, that can sanctify or set apart souls <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>unto God: it
is God the Holy Ghost working in the heart, breaking down the old
man, and constraining the soul to the obedience of the
faith.&nbsp; Let no one then wait for a mission week or a
revivalist preacher, in looking out for great results.&nbsp; The
Holy Spirit is not limited, as some seem to think, to
extraordinary means, or extraordinary agencies.&nbsp; It was when
the Churches had settled down quietly in their quiet Christian
life, that it was said of them that, &lsquo;Walking in the fear
of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they were
multiplied.&rsquo;&nbsp; So we may look for this sanctifying
power of the Holy Ghost to accompany our quiet Christian work;
and I do look for it, and more than that, I thank God for having
granted it in a most remarkable manner in these latter
days.&nbsp; We will not wait then for some future great
occasion.&nbsp; No, indeed: we will not wait even for the
morrow.&nbsp; We will look for the mighty power of the Holy Ghost
now; this day, this hour, before we part.&nbsp; How many are
there amongst us still unsaved!&nbsp; How many that have not yet
surrendered to their Lord!&nbsp; Oh, come then, Mighty Spirit:
come!&nbsp; Come in power: come at once!&nbsp; Come to
subdue,&mdash;come to quicken,&mdash;come to sanctify,&mdash;come
to save!</p>

<h3>SANCTIFICATION THROUGH BLOOD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and
the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to
God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
God?&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heb</span>. ix. 13, 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible to think too much
of the most precious blood of our most blessed Lord and
Saviour.&nbsp; It throws its sacred power over every department
of our Christian life.&nbsp; Our pardon, our peace, our
communion, and our holiness, are all dependent on that most
precious blood.&nbsp; Lose sight of the blood of Christ, and you
lose sight of the very essence of your Christianity.</p>
<p>Our subject to-day is Sanctification through blood.&nbsp;
There are three passages in the Epistle to the Hebrews in which
we find a reference to such a sanctification: viz., x.
29,&mdash;&lsquo;Hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith
he was <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>sanctified, an unholy thing;&rsquo; xiii.
12,&mdash;&lsquo;Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the
people with His own blood, suffered without the gate;&rsquo; and
ix. 13,&mdash;&lsquo;If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the
ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal spirit offered Himself without spot to
God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
God?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I think we must all admit that these passages do not convey to
us the idea of either separation unto God, or of imparted
holiness by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; They seem
rather to refer to the legal result of blood-shedding, or
sacrifice.&nbsp; So I believe they do; and if we would know the
real meaning of sanctification in the Word of God, we must not be
carried away by the recurrence of a familiar word, but pause to
study carefully its real use in this Epistle.</p>
<p>Our first duty then will be to examine what is meant in these
passages by the Sanctification through blood.&nbsp; And after
having ascertained its meaning, we may proceed to consider its
wondrous power.</p>
<p>First, then, what is meant by it?</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>I am
not aware that the expression is ever met with in any portion of
the New Testament except the Epistle to the Hebrews, and this may
at once suggest the idea that it has a Levitical
signification.&nbsp; The great object of that Epistle is to
expound the types of the book of Leviticus, and to show their
fulfilment in our most blessed Saviour.&nbsp; Accordingly in two
out of the three passages there is a direct reference to the
ancient types.&nbsp; It is therefore only natural to expect that
the phraseology employed in the Book of Leviticus, respecting the
types, will reappear in the exposition of those types in the
Epistle.&nbsp; And if we would understand the Epistle, we must
learn from the Book of Leviticus what was the nature of that
sanctification which was effected through blood in the law of
types.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think that these sacrifices produced no
result except in so far as they pointed typically to the Lord
Jesus.&nbsp; But I do not think they will find that opinion borne
out in Scripture.&nbsp; They will find there that, in addition to
their typical and prophetic character, these sacrifices were, at
the time of their being offered, effectual in God&rsquo;s purpose
for the bestowal of certain most important blessings.&nbsp; Thus
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>this
passage says, &lsquo;If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the
ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
purifying of the flesh:&rsquo; the blood then of bulls and of
goats did actually &lsquo;sanctify to the purifying of the
flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a certain act of sanctification there and then
wrought through the application of that blood.&nbsp; It was not
merely that in it through faith believers laid hold on the future
atonement by the coming Saviour, but there was something done for
them at the time; so that after the sacrifice they were in a
position different to that in which they stood before it.</p>
<p>Take the two cases referred to in this verse.&nbsp; First,
there is the sprinkling of the blood of the bullock, as on the
day of atonement.&nbsp; On that occasion the altar was sprinkled
with the blood. (Levit. xvi. 19.)&nbsp; Now the altar was not
actually purified by the sprinkling, as if it had been washed
with water.&nbsp; Yet you read, &lsquo;He shall sprinkle of the
blood upon it&mdash;and cleanse it, and hallow,&rsquo; or
sanctify, &lsquo;it from the uncleanness of the children of
Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp; In that case the altar was cleansed from
legal guilt.&nbsp; In consequence of its contact with the sin of
guilty man it was regarded before God as an unclean thing, and by
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the
sprinkling of blood it was sanctified, or legally cleansed.&nbsp;
Before the sprinkling it was polluted, but afterwards it was
clean, or, in other words, all legal impurity was removed.</p>
<p>The purifying of the flesh by the sprinkling of the ashes of
an heifer was of exactly the same character.&nbsp; The clearest
account of it is given in Num. xix., the passage to which the
Apostle apparently refers.&nbsp; There you find the description
of certain persons who were accounted unclean: as, <i>e.g.</i>,
those who had touched a dead body.&nbsp; And those persons, being
unclean, were cut off from the sanctuary.&nbsp; But when, after
seven days, they were sprinkled with the ashes of the heifer,
their legal uncleanness was removed, and they were restored to
the congregation as clean persons.&nbsp; They were not really
more pure than they were before, but they were no longer
accounted as defiled, and thus they were reinstated into all
their privileges.</p>
<p>The sprinkling of blood and of the ashes, therefore, did
produce a real result.&nbsp; It did not change the inward state
of the heart, but it did alter the position.&nbsp; It was
God&rsquo;s appointed ordinance for the removal of legal guilt;
and it did remove it.&nbsp; It was effectual for its purpose, and
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>after it
had taken place the uncleanness was no more: it might soon
accumulate again, and become possibly worse than ever; but the
past defilement was gone, and the unclean man was clean.</p>
<p>But it did not touch the heart or conscience.&nbsp; It was an
outward act affecting the outward person, and restoring a man to
the sanctuary and congregation; but, if his heart was broken by
the bitter sense of indwelling sin, it could not restore him to
God: if his conscience was grieved by the bitter memory of sad
sin, the ashes of the heifer could not heal that.&nbsp; Suppose a
man had something weighing on his conscience: he might bring his
kid to the altar; but unless he was able in that sacrifice to see
the coming Christ, he would have the bitter pain of past
transgression still festering in his heart.&nbsp; He might be
sprinkled with the ashes of the heifer, and take his place in the
sanctuary of God as if all was right; but that would not take
away his burden.&nbsp; If that were all he would go back from the
sanctuary with a heavy heart.&nbsp; He would be just like
thousands amongst ourselves who have experienced the utter
failure of any external remedy for the wounded conscience.&nbsp;
They have been through the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>whole outward routine of a correct
Christianity,&mdash;prayers, Bible reading, Church services,
sacraments,&mdash;and you may truly say they are sanctified
according to the flesh.&nbsp; But there is a heartache still
within the soul; there is an uncleanness there too deep to be
touched by anything external,&mdash;so deep that it baffles every
effort to cleanse it, and appears to rise with fresh power at the
very time that they endeavour to apply their remedy.&nbsp; It is
this that has always been the great difficulty in our endeavours
to serve the living God, for till this burden is removed it is
sure to keep us in a position of bondage and inability.&nbsp; I
once saw some poor prisoners driven to their work with a long and
heavy chain riveted on their ankles; and what heart or power
could they have for service?&nbsp; And what power can he have who
is toiling on in dreary discouragement with the chain of
unforgiven sin riveted on his soul?&nbsp; It is only the free man
that can walk with God and serve Him.</p>
<p>And now let us turn back to the text, and see how it deals
with the difficulty.&nbsp; It draws the contrast between the
purifying of the flesh and of the conscience, and it shows how
the sprinkling of the ashes of the heifer could accomplish the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>one, but how
the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ could alone affect
the other; for it is that, and that alone, that could
&lsquo;purge the conscience from dead works to serve the living
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason is obvious.&nbsp; That atonement
wrought out by Him, was the atonement planned in the eternal
covenant of God, and, when the time came, completed on purpose to
meet the case of all sin,&mdash;not merely of outward acts, but
the deep inward corruption of the heart; not merely by external
restoration, but by complete, internal restoration to God&rsquo;s
love.&nbsp; It concerns the depths of the soul; and so completely
blots out all sin, that the soul itself, whatever it has been, is
now in Him spotless before God.&nbsp; This is the one secret both
of peace and service.&nbsp; Till your conscience is thus purged
through the blood of Christ, you will never know what it is
really to serve the living God.</p>
<p>And now look at the great contrast of the text, and mark well
the difference between those sacrifices and ours.</p>
<p>The sacrifice in the type was of very little value.&nbsp; The
poor kid was led to the altar, and no one mourned its death; the
poor scapegoat was left alone in the wilderness, and no one gave
it a <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>thought: a few shillings, or even pence, would replace
it with another.&nbsp; It was picked out from the flock by what
we should call mere chance, and no one missed it afterwards.</p>
<p>But how different is our Sacrifice!&nbsp; Consider for a
moment the description given of it in this verse.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Our Lamb was &lsquo;Christ,&rsquo; the Messiah, the
Son of God!&nbsp; As St. Peter said, &lsquo;Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Our Sacrifice was offered in the eternal purpose of
God; or, according to the text, &lsquo;through the eternal
Spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not an accidental selection, but a
gift predetermined in the counsel of Jehovah, so that He is
described by St. Peter as &lsquo;the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; Our Sacrifice gave Himself as a freewill offering to
God.&nbsp; &lsquo;He offered Himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The calf, or
the goat, was chosen by its owner, and, when chosen, had no
knowledge of anything that was before it: it had no voice in the
whole transaction, and knew nothing of what it was to bear.&nbsp;
But our Blessed Saviour, He foresaw the whole.&nbsp; <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>He knew the
whole burden; He realised the whole sorrow; and keenly felt its
bitterness.&nbsp; In His human nature He shrank from the
cup.&nbsp; It was so oppressive to Him that He threw himself
before God &lsquo;with strong cryings and tears, and was heard in
that He feared.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet, with the whole horror of
the dreadful burden fully before Him, and with the full and
entire knowledge of what it was to be forsaken of God, He was so
resolute in carrying out the great plan of the covenant of life,
that He yielded up His own will, and offered Himself as a
sin-offering to God.</p>
<p>(4) Our Sacrifice was &lsquo;without spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was required that the poor kid should be without blemish;
partly to show that God does not accept blemished gifts, but
chiefly because it was typical of the coming Christ.&nbsp; But
the fact that there was no spot, either within or without, did
not add to its real value: the spotted kid would have fetched as
much as the unspotted, in the market.&nbsp; But when it says of
our Sacrifice that He was &lsquo;a lamb without blemish and
without spot,&rsquo; what a tale it tells of His sinless
holiness!&nbsp; His perfect sinlessness had stood the test <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of the whole
of pre-existent eternity.&nbsp; We all know how first impressions
of character become modified by time: imperfections, unseen at
first, soon begin to crop up; there are very few of whom you can
say that you have known them for twenty or thirty years, and
never heard a word escape their lips that you would be sorry to
speak in your dying hour.&nbsp; But there was a oneness for all
eternity between the Father and the Son; yet eternity itself
could discover no flaw, so that when the time came for the great
sacrifice, He was without spot, even before God.&nbsp; He that
was the sin-bearer was Himself sinless; and if you think what is
involved in the statement that &lsquo;He knew no sin,&rsquo; then
you may form some idea of the great fact that sin, even our sin,
was imputed to Him; or, in other words, that &lsquo;God made Him
to be sin for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Looking then at the contrast between the sacrifices, the one,
in comparison to the other, is infinitely little.&nbsp; The poor
calf, or kid, was nothing,&mdash;far less than nothing in
comparison of the Son of God.&nbsp; There was nothing in it that
could stand comparison for a moment.&nbsp; If you look at the
sacrifice of the Son of God, the voluntary offering through the
eternal Spirit of <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>the spotless and Holy One, the sacrifice of the kid
vanishes.&nbsp; It disappears altogether; it is no more than a
grain of dust on the side of a mountain.</p>
<p>Yet those sprinklings under the law were effectual for their
purpose.&nbsp; There was no failure in them: they accomplished
all for which they were intended; every promise made respecting
them was fulfilled.&nbsp; The legal cleansing in all cases was
complete.</p>
<p>Now then, I come to the point.&nbsp; If these sacrifices, so
insignificant, so valueless, and to the eye of man so powerless,
were effective for their purpose,&mdash;shall not that most
marvellous wonder in the whole history of the Godhead, the
sacrifice of the Son of God, be effective for His?&nbsp; It is
true their concern was with the flesh, His with the conscience;
but is there any one prepared to say, &lsquo;They never failed:
but He may&rsquo;?&nbsp; Can any one of us admit for one moment,
that the man who was sprinkled with the ashes of an heifer was
invariably reinstated as a clean man in the sanctuary; and that
there can be the least shadow of the possibility of a doubt that
the blood of Christ is completely restored to fellowship with
God?</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Look at
Him as the Son of God, as the anointed Messiah, as the Spotless
Lamb, as offering Himself in obedience to the Father&rsquo;s
eternal will; and tell me, ye that cannot trust Him,&mdash;Can
such a sacrifice as that fail?&nbsp; Shall that which is
infinitely little succeed, and that which is infinitely great
fail?&nbsp; Can you believe that the blood of a poor little kid
was sufficient, but the blood of the Son of God
insufficient?&nbsp; Think then of the ancient Jew walking home
after his sacrifice, notwithstanding all that had passed, now
clean and reinstated.&nbsp; Then think of the most precious blood
of Christ, the Son of God, the Lamb slain before the foundation
of the world,&mdash;slain too for those very sins that weigh on
the conscience; and consider why should not you go home this day,
as that Jew did in ancient times, Free?&mdash;in the position of
those described by St. Paul, when he said, &lsquo;Such were some
of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God&rsquo;?</p>
<h3><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>THE
CLEANSING BLOOD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But if we walk in the light, as He is in
the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.&rsquo;&mdash;1
<span class="smcap">John</span>, i. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should be the earnest desire of
our hearts, in commemorating the great facts of the crucifixion
of our blessed Saviour, to know the fellowship of His sufferings,
and realise all that He endured.&nbsp; On this account it is well
to dwell on His wounds, His sorrows, His tears, His prayers, and
His bitter cry: but it is well to look also at the power of His
precious blood, and at the great results accomplished in the
covenant of God by that wonderful blood-shedding of the Son of
Man.</p>
<p>I scarcely know which branch of the subject is the more
important of the two, and I propose to-day <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> to consider the latter, and to draw
your thoughts to the power of the blood, as taught us <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>in these
familiar and most sacred words, &lsquo;The blood of Jesus Christ
His Son cleanseth us from all sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; May God so teach
us by His Spirit, that we may know in our own experience the
cleansing power of the blood of Christ!</p>
<p>There are two questions which will require our careful study,
in order to a right understanding of the text.&nbsp; To whom do
the words apply? and what do they mean?</p>
<p>To whom do they apply?</p>
<p>They are often applied in a loose and haphazard way to all
kinds of characters to whom they do not in the least belong, as
drunkards, Sabbath-breakers, and all descriptions of unconverted
men.&nbsp; But the most cursory glance at the text shows that it
has no reference to such characters, and applies exclusively to
those who are walking in the light.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we walk in
the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from
all sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; The blessing is made in this text entirely
dependent on our walking in the light; and if we are not walking
in the light, it does not belong to us.&nbsp; The man who is
still living the life of the unconverted cannot claim it, for he
has never known the light, <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and his poor soul is still darkened
by sin; nor can the backslider, who once saw the light, and now
has turned back into the darkness of the world; for, though he
was in the light once, he is not walking in it now.</p>
<p>There are other passages which apply to such persons, and
invite them to reconciliation through the precious blood of
Christ: but this text does not.&nbsp; It applies to those who
have been brought into the light, and now are walking in it; not
seeking it, nor groping after it, but in it,&mdash;and enjoying a
holy fellowship both with God&rsquo;s people and with God.&nbsp;
There cannot be a higher standard, or, to use modern terms, a
higher life.&nbsp; It is a life in the very presence of God
Himself,&mdash;a life in which every step is lightened by the
sunbeam of His love.&nbsp; Fellowship, light, love, and joy,
abound through the whole of it.&nbsp; The persons possessing it
are happy, loving, peaceful believers, rejoicing in the sacred
privilege of companionship with God; and yet of them the text
declares, &lsquo;The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us
from all sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now, what is meant by the expression &lsquo;Cleanseth us
from all sin?&rsquo;&nbsp; I find that it is sometimes supposed
to mean, &lsquo;the inward cleansing <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of the soul,&rsquo; or the purifying
of the heart by the Holy Ghost, as in Acts, xv. 9:
&lsquo;Purifying their hearts by faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I know
of no other passage of Sacred Scripture in which this is the
meaning of cleansing by blood; whereas there are many in which it
means the removal of all legal guilt, as in Heb. ix. 13, 14,
where the blood of the Jewish sacrifice is said to
&lsquo;sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,&rsquo; and the
blood of Christ &lsquo;to purge the conscience from dead works to
serve the living God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word in that passage in
the Hebrews for &lsquo;purging,&rsquo; is the same as here
rendered &lsquo;cleanseth;&rsquo; and, if there were nothing in
the context to decide it, the general use of the language of
Scripture would be sufficient.&nbsp; But the context appears to
leave no doubt on the subject.&nbsp; The ninth verse clearly
shows that the subject of the forgiveness of sin is the subject
of discussion: &lsquo;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then in the opening of the next
chapter you find the full explanation of the text.&nbsp; The
first two verses are in fact little more than an expansion of
it.&nbsp; The first verse sets before us the highest possible
standard of sinless holiness: <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>&lsquo;My little children, these
things write I unto you, that ye sin not.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
which the Apostle proceeds to show the provision which God has
made for us under the sense of sin: &lsquo;If any man sin we have
an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he
is the propitiation for our sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is an
expansion of the short statement of the text: &lsquo;The blood of
Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
teaches of Christ Jesus, the righteous Advocate and the perfect
Propitiation; it shows that the blood is the blood of atonement,
and the cleansing the blotting out of the guilt of sin through
the propitiation; it points the contrite believer, deeply humbled
for sin, to what is now passing at the right hand of God, where
the Son of God now stands as his Advocate, having completed the
sacrifice, and sprinkled the blood before the mercy-seat.&nbsp;
That sprinkled blood is the cleansing power, and the cleansing is
the blotting out of guilt so completely that the soul stands
before God as free from all legal pollution as if it had never
been defiled.&nbsp; It is perfectly true that there are other
passages in which we read of inward holiness as a purification of
the heart: as <i>e.g.</i>, 1 John, iii. 3.&nbsp; But that is
quite a <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>different thing to the cleansing through blood described
in our text, the real meaning of which is the removal of all
guilt from the guilty sinner by the transfer of it, according to
the covenant, to the great sin-bearer: &lsquo;The Lamb of God
that taketh away the sins of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, this being the case, it appears to me that there are two
great practical conclusions which irresistibly follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, that those who are walking in the light have sin in
them which needs the cleansing blood.&nbsp; I know very well, and
thank God for the blessed assurance that &lsquo;Sin shall not
have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under
grace.&rsquo;&nbsp; I know, too, that our blessed Saviour is the
great deliverer, and that He will so surely and so effectually
save His people from their sins, that every one of them, without
a single exception, will finally be presented without a single
spot, or stain, before His throne.&nbsp; But that is not the
question.&nbsp; The question is whether in saving us it pleases
Him to put an end, while we are in the flesh, to the deep
corruption of our human nature, or to give us invariably such a
victory that we shall never have reason to repent and deplore its
power.&nbsp; If this <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>verse stood alone it would decide the
point, for it shows the deep need of the cleansing blood, even
for those who are walking in the light.&nbsp; It describes two
gifts as the sacred privilege of their life in Christ Jesus:
fellowship one with another, and cleansing through the power of
His blood.&nbsp; It proves, therefore, beyond the possibility of
doubt, that whatever meaning we attach to the word
&lsquo;cleanseth,&rsquo; there is sin which requires to be
cleansed, even in those who are walking in the light.&nbsp; But
it does not stand alone, for the 8th and the 10th verses explain
to us the reason of the need: the one teaches that we &lsquo;have
sin,&rsquo; and the other, that we &lsquo;have sinned;&rsquo; the
one speaks of the deep corruption of our nature, the other of the
action to which this corruption has given rise; and both teach
the same thing,&mdash;viz., that those who are walking in the
light have sin in themselves and in their conduct,&mdash;sin
which requires cleansing; that if &lsquo;they say they have no
sin, they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in
them;&rsquo; and &lsquo;if they say they have not sinned, they
make Him a liar, and His word is not in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe then that the compilers of our Articles were walking
in the light when they <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>wrote that, &lsquo;The infection of
nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated;&rsquo;
that the compilers of our Prayer-book were walking in the light
when they taught us to confess, &lsquo;We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things
which we ought not to have done; and there is no health in
us;&rsquo; and that old Hooker was writing in the light when he
said, &lsquo;If God should yield unto us, not as unto Abraham, if
fifty, forty, thirty, twenty, yea, or if ten good persons could
be found in a city, for their sakes this city should not be
destroyed; but and if He should make us an offer thus large;
search all the generations of men since the fall of our father
Adam, find one man that hath done one action which hath passed
from him pure, without any stain or blemish at all; and for that
one man&rsquo;s only action, neither man nor angel shall feel the
torments which are prepared for both.&nbsp; Do you think that
this ransom to deliver men and angels could be found to be among
the sons of men?&nbsp; The best things which we do have somewhat
in them to be pardoned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is a second lesson: viz., that while there is the
deep need, there is the ample provision; <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>for, although
no ransom could be found among the sons of men, there is a
perfect ransom in the most precious blood of the Son of
God.&nbsp; The propitiation is complete, and, through the
wonderful mercy which God has shown in His covenant, that
precious blood cleanseth from all sin.</p>
<p>There are two points in this sentence to which I would draw
your special attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(1.)&nbsp; It is <i>all</i> sin that is cleansed.&nbsp;
Sin after baptism, as well as sin before it; sin committed in the
light, as well as sin in the days of darkness; sin of omission,
and sin of commission; sin of act, sin of word, sin of thought,
sin of temper, sin of desire, sin of heart, sin in the acts of
religion, and sin in daily life; sin that is not noticed as it
ought to be, and sin that leaves an inexpressible pain on the
conscience.&nbsp; It is all included in the one word
&lsquo;<i>all</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The blood of Jesus Christ
his Son cleanseth us from <i>all</i> sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; It is a continuous cleansing: that is, continued
day by day as long as the walk lasts.&nbsp; It is well explained
by those words, John, xiii. 10: &lsquo;He that is,&rsquo; or hath
been, &lsquo;washed needeth not <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>save to wash his feet, but is clean
every whit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The first great washing took place when
you were first brought to Christ, as represented in your baptism;
and now as you are walking home through a defiling world, you
require the continual cleansing of the feet.&nbsp; And this is
what is promised in the text.&nbsp; We are walking, and the blood
is cleansing.&nbsp; It might be rendered, &lsquo;If we are
walking in the light, the blood is cleansing us from all
sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; The walk is continuous, and the cleansing
continuous likewise.&nbsp; As we are taught in the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer to ask for daily forgiveness with the same regularity as
we ask for daily bread; so we are taught to trust the cleansing
power for every step of the daily life.&nbsp; Day after day, and
night after night, we return to the same fountain, and there
experience the same power; and so it will be to the end, when all
this earthly walking shall cease, and the ransomed spirit shall
appear spotless before God.</p>
<p>But let us not speak of the blood, and its cleansing power,
without remembering well what we mean by it.&nbsp; We do not mean
the material blood which flowed from the feet and hands, or
trickled down his careworn face from beneath <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the crown of
thorns; nor that which after death gushed from His pierced side;
for we can never be sprinkled by that.&nbsp; Still less do we
mean what some suppose to be actual blood in the
transubstantiated cup.&nbsp; We mean nothing material: for
nothing material can cleanse the soul.&nbsp; We mean the
sacrifice of the life of the Son of God as an efficacious
offering for the life of the sinner.</p>
<p>In the sacred history of that mysterious death, we read His
bitter cry: &lsquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; This cry it is utterly impossible to explain on
any other principle than the imputation of sin.&nbsp; I am not
one of those that would dare to speak of impossibilities with
God.&nbsp; But when I think of the eternal and spotless holiness
of the Lord Jesus, of His perfect purity and His blameless life,
I find it utterly impossible to myself to imagine on what
principle He could have been forsaken at such a moment by one
with whom he had been one for eternity, if it had not been that
sin, not His own, was imputed to Him; or in the words of Sacred
Scripture, that &lsquo;The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of
us all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, when I turn to the dying cry,
&lsquo;It is finished,&rsquo; I see the completion of the
work.&nbsp; What He had undertaken <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>He had borne: what He covenanted to
do was done.&nbsp; The covenanted ransom was paid; the covenanted
sacrifice offered; the covenanted life given; and then, the
burden being gone, He yielded up His soul into the Father&rsquo;s
hands, and said, &lsquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend my
spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; This explains what we mean by the power of
the cleansing blood.&nbsp; We mean the full and perfect freedom
given to all those who are in Christ Jesus; because He, as their
Head, has paid their penalty.&nbsp; We look on Him forsaken, and
believe that we shall never be.&nbsp; We look on Him bearing the
full penalty of the law, and we know that because He has borne
it, the awful curse will never rest on us.&nbsp; We listen to Him
crying, &lsquo;It is finished,&rsquo; and we know that nothing
more can be needed in sacrifice; that the whole redemption as
planned in God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is complete; and that
therefore, as He did, so may we commend into a loving
Father&rsquo;s hand all we are, and all we care for, saying,
&lsquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit, for Thou hast
redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; We need no
priest&rsquo;s absolution; and we cannot endure the thought of
any continuation, or repetition, or any thing approaching to
propitiatory <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>sacrifice.&nbsp; We believe that the whole work is
finished according to the purpose of God Himself, and that
&lsquo;the blood of Jesus Christ his Son,&rsquo; without any
addition of any kind whatever,&mdash;simply and
alone,&mdash;&lsquo;cleanseth from all sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus we
agree, heart and soul, with the grand old words of <span
class="smcap">Hooker</span>: &lsquo;Let it be counted folly, or
frenzy, or fury, whatsoever, it is our comfort, our wisdom; we
care for no knowledge in the world but this,&mdash;that man hath
sinned, and God hath suffered; that God hath made Himself the Son
of Man, and that men are made the righteousness of
God.&rsquo;</p>

40</span>PERSONAL HOLINESS.</h2>
<h3>THE SANCTIFIED.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth,
to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints,
with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ
our Lord, both their&rsquo;s and our&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&mdash;1
<span class="smcap">Cor</span>. i. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">hope</span> it has been made clear that
the original meaning of the word &lsquo;to sanctify,&rsquo; was
&lsquo;to set apart as a holy thing unto God,&rsquo; and that the
Levitical meaning of sanctification through blood was the
cleansing from all legal impurity.&nbsp; It is obvious that both
these divine acts clearly involve personal holiness.</p>
<p>That which is set apart by the call of God, and cleansed from
all guilt, should clearly be kept holy and undefiled from the
pollution both of the heart and of the world.&nbsp; Such persons
should be like the vessels of the sanctuary: &lsquo;sanctified
and meet for the Master&rsquo;s use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This leads us to that which is the ordinary <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>meaning of
the term in religious books: viz. personal holiness.&nbsp; By
personal holiness is meant the sacred work of God the Holy Ghost
within the soul; the reflection of the character of our Blessed
Lord; the law put into the inward part, and written on the heart
by the Spirit of God.&nbsp; This is the meaning of such texts as
1 Thess. v. 23: &lsquo;The very God of peace sanctify you wholly;
and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The separation is a past act, for if we are in Christ Jesus, we
have been already separated unto God; but this is an abiding
condition, for real holiness is a present matter of daily
life.&nbsp; Now both these parts of sanctification are brought
out in the words which I have read as our text, for it is
addressed &lsquo;to them that are,&rsquo; or have been,
&lsquo;sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints.&rsquo;&nbsp; The first clause refers to the past act, and
represents those believers as having been set apart unto God, or
separated as a peculiar people unto Himself; the second describes
their present condition as inseparable from their high calling;
for, having been set apart, they are now called to be the saints
of <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>God.&nbsp; I need not stop to point out that the word
&lsquo;saints,&rsquo; is not limited in Sacred Scripture to those
who are in heaven.&nbsp; Still less has it to do with the
canonization of Rome, or the seclusion of a monastery.&nbsp; It
describes the personal holiness of the Christian in common life,
the habitual character of the man walking with God; as in those
words of the Apostle Peter (1 Pet. i. 15): &lsquo;Be ye
holy;&rsquo; or be ye saints, &lsquo;in all manner of
conversation.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that our text means the same as if
it had been written, &lsquo;To them that have been set apart unto
God in Christ Jesus their Saviour, and who, as the result of that
sacred call, are now leading holy lives in His
presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My object this morning will be simply to trace the connexion
between these two steps of God&rsquo;s sacred work: the past
separation unto Him, and the present personal holiness of
character.&nbsp; And all I can say is, may the Lord help us in
our own experience to understand both of them, and then we shall
have no difficulty in perceiving how they are bound together in
the work of Salvation!</p>
<p>We shall find them connected by a principle and a power.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>I.&nbsp; A <span class="smcap">Principle</span>.&nbsp;
It is perfectly clear, as a matter of principle, that there ought
to be holiness in all that is consecrated to God.&nbsp; He
consecrated, or set apart unto Himself, the Sabbath day, and so
He says, &lsquo;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it
holy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Temple, like our own churches, was
consecrated to God, and therefore we read, &lsquo;Holiness
becometh Thine house for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; The vessels of the
Temple were dedicated, or sanctified to His service, and
therefore they should not be touched by unhallowed hands, and the
words of sacred Scripture are, &lsquo;Be ye clean, that bear the
vessels of the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; On these principles we none
like to see a neglected church, a dishonoured Bible, or a
careless attitude, in the house of God.&nbsp; On the same
principles, we should all be profoundly humbled when unhallowed
thoughts,&mdash;thoughts of the world, thoughts of vanity, of
jealousy, or of self,&mdash;in any shape intrude into holy
things, and corrupt those sacred hours which are set apart
exclusively to God.&nbsp; But if this applies to consecration
generally, how pre-eminently does it apply to such a consecration
as that described in the text, in which we are said to be
&lsquo;sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; That
sanctification is the introduction <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of the ruined sinner into a covenant
union with the Son of God.&nbsp; If you have been thus sanctified
in Christ Jesus, you no longer stand alone, to bear your own
burden, or plead your own cause.&nbsp; You have been separated
from the ruined world, and identified with the Lord Jesus; so
that He represented you in bearing your curse when He suffered,
and He now represents you at the right hand of the throne of God,
while He pleads on your behalf.&nbsp; Thus you are cleansed from
all legal guilt.&nbsp; You are sanctified by blood, and charged
with no defilement.&nbsp; By the eternal covenant of God He is
become your Head, so that in His death you died; in His life you
live; in His acceptance you are justified; and in His glory you
are glorified.</p>
<p>But, if you are thus separated unto such a union with Him, is
there any room left for one moment&rsquo;s doubt as to what ought
to be your character?&nbsp; If you are set apart by Him into this
covenant union with Himself, you are set apart into a oneness of
mind, of will, and of interest.&nbsp; He represents you in
heaven, and you represent Him on earth; as God sees you in Him,
so the world sees Him in you.&nbsp; You bear His name; you are
sealed with the seal of the <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>covenant; you are made a peculiar
people unto the Son of God: and I am sure we must all see the
justice of those words of the Apostle Peter, &lsquo;As He who
hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Power</span>.&nbsp; But here
lies the difficulty.&nbsp; You really wish to be holy, but you
are not; you have endeavoured to overcome your temper, but it is
still there; you have striven against wandering thoughts in
prayer, but they still interfere most mournfully with your most
sacred acts of worship; you wish, and you mean to be, unselfish,
but you find selfishness continually cropping up, to your sorrow
and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; Now, the question is,&mdash;How is
this to be overcome?&nbsp; Your resolves will not do it, for you
have made hundreds, and failed in them all; and no man on earth
can do it for you, for the evil lies far too deep for the reach
of man.&nbsp; What then is to be done?&nbsp; We may turn back to
our text, and there learn the secret, for in those words,
&lsquo;In Christ Jesus,&rsquo; we are taught the power.</p>
<p>We learned, in studying the first act of separation, that it
was the work of God the Holy <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Ghost: here it is said to be in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Some people dwell more on the distinction
than I am myself disposed to do: there is such a perfect oneness
in the infinite God, that I confess I have but little heart for
these refined distinctions.&nbsp; As the Father and the Son are
one, so God the Son and God the Holy Ghost are one; and when the
Lord Jesus saves the sinner, it is the Holy Ghost that applies
that salvation to the soul.&nbsp; Without stopping, therefore, to
study any such distinction, let us rather hasten to the practical
lesson that sanctification, or consecration, here described, is a
sanctification in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You may look thus to your
covenant union with Him, and trust Him by the in-breathing of His
own Spirit to make you holy.&nbsp; You may remember that He came
to save you from your sins, and not merely from their curse; and
that holiness is just as much a gift of the covenant as
pardon.</p>
<p>You remember those words, 1 Cor. i. 30: &lsquo;But of Him are
ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They teach us that the Lord Jesus is the source of all practical
wisdom and holiness, just as much as of imputed <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>righteousness
and redemption.&nbsp; The passage is clearly not speaking of an
imputed wisdom, and we have no right to apply it to an imputed
sanctification.&nbsp; It refers to the practical wisdom and
personal holiness of the man who by God&rsquo;s grace is wise and
holy; and teaches that both one and the other are found
exclusively in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>You may, therefore, trust the Lord Jesus Christ for your
sanctification just as much as for your justification; for your
personal holiness in daily life, as well as for your safety in
the great day of judgment.&nbsp; Look carefully then unto your
covenant union with Christ, and think on Him as your covenant
Head: then spread out all your difficulties and temptations
before Him as your Head.&nbsp; Acknowledge before Him how you
have dishonoured His headship by your evil thoughts, your evil
words, and your constant failures; and trust Him, as your Head,
to form in you His image, and by His own most Holy Spirit to give
you the victory.&nbsp; Do not stand at a distance, thinking it
your duty to doubt your union, for by so doing you will never
overcome.&nbsp; Without that union you will never know what
victory means.&nbsp; I am assuming now that in the <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>secret of
your own souls you have been verily engrafted into Christ.&nbsp;
I know you were sacramentally in baptism, but I am looking deeper
than that, for many who are baptized are never saved, and I am
speaking now of the real saving union of your soul with Christ
Himself.&nbsp; Now, if that is yours through His wonderful grace,
accept it, act upon it, trust Him as your living Head; and you
will find, as time goes on, that though you cannot overcome, He
can; and that He will finally present you, &lsquo;holy and
unblameable before Him at His coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; But here we
are brought to the old difficulty,&mdash;that you have no real
evidence in your soul of the existence of such a union with
Christ.&nbsp; You know there is your baptismal union, but still
you cannot feel safe, and you greatly doubt whether you are
amongst those who have been &lsquo;Sanctified in Christ Jesus:
called to be saints.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is the reason why many of
you cannot come to the sacred feast of the Supper of the Lord,
and why many others, who do come, come with a heavy heart.&nbsp;
Would to God we might see those absent ones brought near, and
those heavy hearts gladdened by the Lord!&nbsp; But in order to
that you must grapple at once with the great question <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of your own
personal salvation,&mdash;your separation unto God.&nbsp; Till
that is settled you will be powerless against yourself.&nbsp;
Till you are in Christ, and sanctified in Christ Jesus, you will
never be sanctified at all.&nbsp; If you really desire to be
really holy, for the sake of that holiness begin at the
beginning, and never rest till you are safe.&nbsp; Your safety
must come before your holiness, or you will wait for it for
ever.&nbsp; Begin therefore with the prayer, &lsquo;Lord, save
me: I perish.&rsquo;&nbsp; Throw yourself into His hand for
pardon, for acceptance, for life.&nbsp; Never rest till you can
appropriate the language of St. Paul: &lsquo;Who hath saved me,
and called me with an holy calling.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, when that
is given, you may go on to those other words of the same Apostle,
and say, &lsquo;According as He hath chosen us in Him before the
foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
before Him in love.&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But we all, with open face beholding as in
a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image

Lord.&rsquo;&mdash;2 <span class="smcap">Cor</span>. iii. 18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of personal holiness is
one of overwhelming interest to all those who really desire to
walk with God; it is also one which requires our most careful
study, for in it lies the chief difficulty of the daily Christian
life of the greater number of true believers.&nbsp; They know the
truth, and love it; they prize their Saviour far above all that
the world can give; they are ready either to live or die in His
service; but yet they are so conscious of the power of indwelling
sin that sometimes they are led almost to doubt the reality of
their Christianity, and begin to question whether they really
love their Lord at all.&nbsp; For the help of such persons it
seems clearly a duty to look carefully into the subject, and I <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>pray God that
He may help us to do so this morning.</p>
<p>This text will supply us with so much instruction that we will
not attempt to examine other passages, but will endeavour to
gather from it the standard, the progress, the means, and the
power of Christian holiness.&nbsp; May God so bless His word, as
to make us holy by His Spirit!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Standard</span>.&nbsp; How
many a noble ship has been lost through some inaccuracy in the
compass!&nbsp; If the compass points too much to the east or to
the west, the most careful commander may wreck his vessel.&nbsp;
And if the compass of the soul is in a wrong direction you will
find it very hard to walk in a right path.&nbsp; Now, in this
text the one standard is the image of the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; We
are said to behold the glory of the Lord, and to be changed into
His image.&nbsp; There cannot be a doubt that this refers to the
Lord Jesus Christ, and that by His glory is meant His
grace.&nbsp; If there were, it would be settled by these words in
John, i. 14: &lsquo;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;
and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great
manifestation <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>of the glory of God is in the grace and truth of the
incarnate Word.&nbsp; If, then, we would be holy, as God is holy,
we must be changed into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
When we are like Him we shall be holy, harmless, undefiled, and
separate from sinners; but not before.&nbsp; So you will find
that, when persons speak about their sinlessness, it may
generally be traced to their adopting a low standard of
holiness.&nbsp; Sometimes people will set up their own experience
as a standard, and really seem to think that we are to receive
their accounts of their own experience as if it were another
Bible.&nbsp; Sometimes we read of a perfection, not absolute, but
&lsquo;up to the measure of to-day&rsquo;s
consciousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; Accordingly I have read of one
described as an eminent Christian, who &lsquo;said that a few
days more would make twenty-one years that his obedience had been
kept at the extreme verge of his light.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am not
sure that I know what the writer means, and I may possibly
misunderstand his words; but, if they mean what they seem to
mean, I can scarcely imagine anything more delusive.&nbsp; We
know very well how the eyes may be blinded, the heart deadened,
and the conscience seared by sin; we know that the <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>deeper a man
is sunk in sin the less he feels it, and the lower his fall the
more profound his want of feeling; and only imagine what must be
the result if a deadened, thickened, darkened conscience were to
be accepted as the measure of a sinless life.&nbsp; The idea
reminds one of these words of St. Paul, 2 Cor. x. 12: &lsquo;They
measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
among themselves, are not wise.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nay: they go
further, and point to the tremendous danger pointed out by our
Lord Himself: &lsquo;If the light that is in thee be darkness,
how great is that darkness.&rsquo; (Matt. vi. 23.)&nbsp; No: we
must have a standard rising high above either consciousness,
conscience, or our own light; a standard that never varies; a
standard that does not go up and down with our changes of feeling
or opinion; a standard as unchanging as the perfect character of
God Himself!&nbsp; This is the standard which we find in the Lord
Jesus Christ,&mdash;in God manifest in the flesh: and what is
more, thanks be to God, this is the standard which we shall one
day reach!&nbsp; For, though there are many things still hidden,
there is one thing we most assuredly know, and that is, that <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>&lsquo;when
He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Progress</span>.&nbsp; As I
have just said, when we see the Lord as He is we shall be like
Him; and when that comes to pass we shall see the perfection of
the promise, He &lsquo;shall save His people from their
sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; He will so completely save them that whereas
He finds them corrupt, ruined, and enemies to God by wicked
works, He will finally present them holy and unblameable, without
spot and without blemish before the throne.&nbsp; It is
impossible to imagine anything more blessed, more wonderful, more
divine, than such a change.&nbsp; Now it becomes a question of
the deepest interest whether this mighty change is accomplished
by one instantaneous act, or gradually.&nbsp; Is it, like
justification, a completed thing? or is it a progressive work,
commenced at the new birth, but not complete till we see Him as
He is?&nbsp; There cannot be a more important practical
inquiry.&nbsp; And now you may see the importance of the
distinction drawn between the different senses of the word
&lsquo;sanctification;&rsquo; or, as it might be better
expressed, the different <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>parts of that blessed work.&nbsp; If
you speak of sanctification as the original act of God in
separating us unto Himself, then it is a completed thing, for we
are described as &lsquo;having been sanctified in Christ
Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, again, you speak of it as a legal
cleansing from all past guilt, it is complete, for being washed
in the precious blood we are already clean.&nbsp; But if you
regard it as the personal holiness of daily life, the purifying
the heart through faith by the indwelling power of the Holy
Ghost, then I am prepared to maintain from the whole testimony of
the whole Word of God from one end to the other, that so long as
we are in this world of conflict the sacred work is not complete,
but progressive.&nbsp; How people can speak of sanctification in
this sense as an immediate work, I am at a loss to
understand.&nbsp; Hundreds of passages might be quoted to prove
its progressive character, and to show the reason of its present
incompleteness: viz., the abiding power of indwelling sin.&nbsp;
I have only time to refer to two.&nbsp; In the first place, this
verse describes us as changed, or being changed, from glory to
glory.&nbsp; We are described as in the process of
transformation, or metamorphosis; by His grace passing from glory
to glory, or from <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>one degree of grace to another.&nbsp; The work is in
progress, thanks be to God! and we have the bright hope of the
completed likeness of the Lord.&nbsp; But that bright hope is not
yet realized, nor will it be till we see Him as He is.&nbsp; I
will take only one other passage, and select it because it
corresponds very closely to the text.&nbsp; It is a passage
addressed to the believers in Rome,&mdash;to persons who are
described as being &lsquo;beloved of God called to be
saints.&rsquo; (Rom. i. 7.)&nbsp; There can be no doubt then that
the work of personal holiness was begun in them: yet what does
St. Paul say to them? (Rom. xii. 2.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Be not
conformed to this world: but be ye transformed (or
metamorphosized) by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Is it not clear then that those persons who
were beloved of God, and called to be saints, were still to be
reaching forth after higher attainments?&nbsp; There was so much
evil in them that they still required to be warned against
conformity to the world, and so far were they from their high
standard, that they required nothing less than a transformation
or metamorphosis (it is the same word as in the text), in order
to bring them into a personal experience <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>&lsquo;of the
good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be
sure then there is no resting-place in Christian holiness for the
saints of God.&nbsp; The Lord may have done great things for us,
whereof we are glad.&nbsp; He may have given us such an insight
into His grace that we now love that which we once cared nothing
for, and hate that which we once loved: He may have led us to say
from the bottom of our hearts, &lsquo;I delight to do Thy will, O
my God.&rsquo;&nbsp; But our motto must still be,
&lsquo;Forgetting those things that are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things that are before, I press towards the mark
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The more we love Christ, the more must we be
deeply humbled that we love Him so little; and the more we look
at the blessed prospect of a real and perfect sinlessness, the
more must we be ready to say, as St. Paul did, &lsquo;Not as
though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I
follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
apprehended of Christ Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But some of you will be ready to say that that is
just where your difficulty lies.&nbsp; You <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>do really
desire to be going forward, and to be making progress, but it
seems as if you could not.&nbsp; You are like a person in a
nightmare, who wishes to run, but cannot.&nbsp; Let us then
consider what is God&rsquo;s great instrument, whereby He imparts
progress to the soul.&nbsp; On this subject this text is quite
decisive, for it shows that God&rsquo;s great instrument is the
view of the Lord Jesus Christ through faith.&nbsp; In the passage
to which I have already referred in 1 John, iii. 2, we find that
the perfect view of the Lord Jesus will lead to perfect likeness,
so in these words the partial view leads to progressive
likeness.&nbsp; When the view is perfect the likeness will be
perfect too; now that the view is imperfect, only as through a
glass, the likeness is imperfect likewise.&nbsp; But still it is
growing more and more; for &lsquo;we all,&rsquo;&mdash;not merely
special Christians, who have attained what they call &lsquo;the
higher life,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;beholding as in a glass the
glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
glory.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now I believe it is impossible to press this
too strongly on all those who desire holiness, for there is a
perpetual tendency in every one of us to turn the eye inward on
ourselves, instead of keeping it fixed on Him.&nbsp; Some are
occupied with what <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>they feel, or do not feel, or wish to feel, or wish they
did not feel; and some by what they do, or mean to do, or think
they ought to do,&mdash;till the whole mind becomes bewildered,
and the whole soul entangled.&nbsp; Remember that you may be
entangled by your religious efforts, as well as by your sins:
nothing indeed entangles people more than confused and mistaken
religion.&nbsp; So that if you really want to be like Him, you
must sweep away all your entanglements like so many cobwebs, and,
just as you are, look straight at Him.&nbsp; For example, you say
you do not feel sin, and you do not feel anything like the sorrow
for it that you know you ought to do.&nbsp; I have no doubt you
are perfectly right, and it is very sorrowful, very sinful, and
very sad.&nbsp; But how is it to be overcome?&nbsp; I know of
only one way, and that is a very simple one, too simple for many
of you,&mdash;and that is a look: you must behold Christ.&nbsp;
Remember the case of the Jews.&nbsp; Nothing yet has melted their
hearts: their great national afflictions have utterly failed: but
in God&rsquo;s time there will be a change.&nbsp; We shall see
those people mourning,&mdash;so mourning that they will be led
with broken hearts to the Fountain open for sin and for
uncleanness.&nbsp; And what <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>will be God&rsquo;s instrument for
producing such a change?&nbsp; By what means will He effect
it?&nbsp; By a look: a simple look!&nbsp; You find it described
in Zech. xii. 10: &lsquo;They shall look on Me whom they have
pierced, and shall mourn for him.&rsquo;&nbsp; That one look will
accomplish more than 1800 years of bitter, and most afflictive,
discipline.&nbsp; And it is just the same with ourselves.&nbsp;
One look at our loving and living Saviour will do more towards
softening the heart than hours spent in the scrutiny of feeling,
or whole books of self-examination.&nbsp; If you want to grow in
grace, in tenderness of conscience, in holy abhorrence of sin, in
purity of heart, in lowliness of spirit, and in thankful love for
your blessed Saviour,&mdash;then look on Him, keep your eyes on
Him.&nbsp; Think on His Cross, how He died for you; on His life,
how He lived for you; on His advocacy, how He pleads for you; on
His perfect character, His love, His holiness, His purity, His
power, His grace, His truth: for by such a look, and such a look
alone, can you ever hope to be changed into His image.</p>
<p>But remember one expression in the text: viz. those three
words, &lsquo;With open face.&rsquo;&nbsp; The look that
transforms is a look with an open <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>face: there must be nothing
between.&nbsp; There must not be a veil over it, as there is over
the Jews, as you read in verse 15.&nbsp; Every barrier must be
removed.&nbsp; The great barrier of the curse is gone, through
the blood of atonement; and we must not now set up fresh barriers
of our own creation.&nbsp; We must remember the hymn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Just as I am: Thy love alone<br />
Has broken every barrier down;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and just as we are,&mdash;humbled, unworthy, cold, and
unfeeling, but yet admitted into the very presence of the
Lord,&mdash;we must look with open face at the Son of God
Himself; and I hope we may be able to say, as David did,
&lsquo;They looked to Him, and were lightened, and their faces
were not ashamed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; But the look is not enough; for besides all means
there must be a power.&nbsp; We cannot will ourselves into the
likeness of our Saviour, any more than an animal can will itself
into a man: the great transformation must be by the power of a
life-creating agent.&nbsp; So, when I turn again to this text, I
find that it is not the look <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>alone which effects the change, but
that it is God the Holy Ghost making use of the look, and by
divine omnipotence transforming the soul into the image of the
Lord Jesus.&nbsp; In the last words of the text it is all
ascribed to Him, as in the words, &lsquo;Even as by the Spirit of
the Lord,&rsquo; or, as the margin has it, &lsquo;Even as by the
Lord the Spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have no time to dwell on this
subject as I should like to do; but I cannot conclude without
begging the careful attention of all those who are almost tempted
to think that there is something in their constitution which
blocks the way against their progress.&nbsp; They see others
going forward while they stand still; they hear of others filled
with peace in believing, while they are still hampered by doubt,
so that they begin to think they shall never rise, and are never
intended to rise, above their present condition.&nbsp; I quite
admit that it may be perfectly true, that there is something
peculiar in your case; something peculiar, it may be, in your
habits, in your disposition, in your temper, in your
temptation.&nbsp; Let us admit it, for most people have their
peculiar difficulties.&nbsp; But, admitting it, I pray you to
consider whether there is not a Divine power in the Lord the <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Spirit, which
is quite sufficient to overcome that peculiarity.&nbsp; Is any
thing too hard for the Lord?&nbsp; Think then on God the Holy
Ghost: think of Him as working out the great salvation purchased
for us through the precious blood of the Son of God, and then
reflect whether it is possible that your difficulties are beyond
His power.&nbsp; They are beyond your own: you have learned
that.&nbsp; But are they beyond His?&nbsp; If you have failed, is
that any reason why He should?&nbsp; Trust Him then, and behold
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Remember you are dealing with One mighty to
save, and that, while you are looking to Jesus, He, working
within, may heal your soul.&nbsp; Trust Him then to do it.&nbsp;
You know He can; trust Him that He will: and never again admit
the thought, that, notwithstanding all you have discovered in
your soul, there is any thing there too hard for the Son of
God,&mdash;anything which may not be overcome by the indwelling
power of God the Holy Ghost.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&nbsp; So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God;
but with the flesh the law of sin.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rom</span>. vii. 25. <a name="citation64"></a><a
href="#footnote64" class="citation">[64]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few passages in the whole
word of God that have excited a deeper interest amongst truly
Christian people than the latter part of the seventh of
Romans.&nbsp; It is so closely connected with the practical
experience of Christian life, and at the same time it is so much
opposed to the beautiful theories of some Christian people, that
it has always excited an earnest spirit of inquiry, and engaged
the deepest interests of the students of Scripture.&nbsp; I
propose to make it the subject of our study this morning: to
endeavour to find out what the Scripture really teaches.&nbsp;
And in the outset of our study I should wish to give one caution,
which I believe to be of the <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>utmost importance for us all: viz.,
we must not bring the sacred Scriptures to the test of our
theories, but must be prepared, if need be, to give up those
theories to the authority of Scripture.&nbsp; If we want to live
in God&rsquo;s truth, we must be subject to God&rsquo;s Word, and
must be content to receive what He teaches as He teaches
it.&nbsp; In other words, we must not twist Scripture so as to
make it fit our own opinions, but must receive it as from God,
and make all our opinions bend before its high authority.</p>
<p>With this caution before us, there are three subjects to be
considered.&nbsp; First, of whom is the Apostle speaking: of
himself, or some other man?&nbsp; Secondly, of what period in his
Christian life is he speaking: does he refer to the past or to
the present?&nbsp; And thirdly, what does the passage teach
respecting his spiritual condition at the time he wrote the
words?</p>
<p>And now, may God the Holy Ghost, who inspired the Word, lead
us all reverently to study, and rightly to understand, His
teaching!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; To whom does it refer?&nbsp; I feel persuaded that we
shall all admit that, if any person were to read the chapter
without having some previous <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>opinion to support, he would believe
that the Apostle was speaking of himself.&nbsp; The word
&lsquo;I&rsquo; occurs no less than twenty-eight times in the
passage.&nbsp; Such expressions as &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; &lsquo;I
consent,&rsquo; &lsquo;I allow,&rsquo; &lsquo;I delight,&rsquo;
are found continually; and certainly the natural conclusion would
be that when he said, &lsquo;I,&rsquo; he meant himself.&nbsp; I
know that it is sometimes said that he personated some other
person; a legalist, or one in a lower Christian life.&nbsp; But
there is not the least evidence of any such personation in the
passage, and he says not one word to lead us to suppose that such
was his intention.&nbsp; In iii. 5, he does thus personate an
objector; and says, &lsquo;But if our unrighteousness
commend,&rsquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; But then he distinctly states that
he is doing so in the words, &lsquo;I speak as a
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there is nothing of the kind here.&nbsp;
There is a plain, simple statement in his own name; passing from
the &lsquo;I,&rsquo; which pervades the chapter, to &lsquo;I,
myself,&rsquo; in the last verse; and I am utterly at a loss to
understand on what principle these plain words, &lsquo;I
myself,&rsquo; can be supposed to express the personation of some
other man.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; In answer then to our first question, I <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>am brought to
the conclusion that when he spoke of &lsquo;I myself,&rsquo; he
meant himself, and not another: and we may pass to our second
question.&nbsp; To what period of his spiritual history did he
refer: did he speak of the past, or of the present?&nbsp; Was he
describing some period of past anxiety out of which he had been
delivered, so as to enter on the joys of the eighth
chapter?&nbsp; Or was he speaking of his state of mind at the
very time, that he was writing the eighth chapter, and declaring,
&lsquo;Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father?&rsquo;&nbsp; In answer to this I have not the
smallest hesitation in saying that, according to every principle
of sound exposition, the seventh chapter refers to exactly the
same period as the eighth; that it is a description of his own
experience at the time he wrote the words; and that we should
have just as much authority for saying that the eighth chapter
referred only to the future, as that the seventh referred only to
the past.&nbsp; For this I give three reasons:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; If we wish to understand the Word of God we must
receive plain words as we find <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>them in sacred Scripture.&nbsp; We
have no right to assume that the present tense stands for the
past; that &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; means &lsquo;I was;&rsquo; that
&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; means &lsquo;I used to do;&rsquo; that
&lsquo;I hate,&rsquo; means &lsquo;I used to hate;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;I delight,&rsquo; means &lsquo;I used to
delight.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we once begin thus to handle Scripture
there is an end to exposition; and if people who thus twist
Scripture would be consistent, they ought to go on, and say that
the beginning of this verse, &lsquo;I thank God through Jesus
Christ our Lord,&rsquo; means, &lsquo;I used to thank Him, but I
do not now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Again, the transition from the past to the present
is clearly marked in the passage.&nbsp; In the parenthesis which
extends from the seventh verse to the end of the chapter, we find
the three tenses,&mdash;past, present, and future.&nbsp; From
verse seven to verse thirteen it is all in the past, and is a
description of a certain portion of his past life.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
was alive;&rsquo; &lsquo;the commandment came;&rsquo; &lsquo;sin
revived;&rsquo; &lsquo;I died;&rsquo; &lsquo;I found it to be
unto death;&rsquo; and &lsquo;sin deceived me, and by it slew
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a description of the great work of God in
breaking down his pharisaism, and bringing him to Christ.&nbsp; I
believe it all took place during those solemn three days at
Damascus.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>But from the fourteenth verse to the end, all is
changed, and the present tense is employed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am;&rsquo; &lsquo;I do;&rsquo; &lsquo;I allow;&rsquo; &lsquo;I
delight;&rsquo; &lsquo;I hate;&rsquo; &lsquo;I thank God;&rsquo;
&lsquo;I serve.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only exception is in the
twenty-fourth verse, where we find the future: &lsquo;who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?&rsquo;&nbsp; This
distinction of the tenses is alone enough to prove the point, for
it would be just as reasonable to maintain that the past means
the present, as that the present means the past.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Once more.&nbsp; The noble thanksgiving of verse
twenty-five is supposed to be the point of transition from the
sadness of the seventh chapter to the joys of the eighth; the
conclusion of his conflict in the discovery of the Lord
Jesus.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that this passage does
describe the act of faith rejoicing in the Divine
Deliverer.&nbsp; It describes the believer grasping the victory,
and rising through grace above the conflict within his
soul.&nbsp; We quite admit it, and fully accept that explanation
of the words.&nbsp; But now, here is the remarkable point: this
account of a struggle within the soul is found&mdash;where?&nbsp;
Not only before the thanksgiving of victory, but also after it;
proving thereby that it is deeply <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>felt, even by those who can give
thanks for an overcoming Saviour.&nbsp; And more than that.&nbsp;
People draw a distinction between what they call the unhappy
seventh and the happy eighth; but this verse comes between the
thanksgiving of the seventh chapter and the assurance of no
condemnation in the eighth.&nbsp; It follows the thanksgiving,
and leads on immediately to the grand, and most blessed
declaration, with which the eighth chapter opens: &lsquo;There
is, therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, therefore, I conclude that the Apostle was
speaking of himself, and not of another: and that he spoke of
himself at the very time that he was assured of no condemnation
in the present, and no separation for all eternity: of a perfect
safety in his union with the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We may pass
then to our last subject.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; What does the passage teach us respecting the
experience of the Apostle at the time when he wrote the
Epistle?&nbsp; Perhaps I ought to limit the question by rather
saying, What was his experience with reference to the law?&nbsp;
For <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the
whole object of the passage is to bring out the holiness of the
law, and to prove from his own case that the &lsquo;commandment
was holy, and just, and good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The first thing that is conspicuously clear is that
he had discovered its true character.&nbsp; When he was a
legalist he had no idea of its exalted standard; but, when God
called him, his eyes were opened to behold its perfection.&nbsp;
It is a curious fact that those who hope to save themselves by
their doings are almost certain to entertain but low and limited
notions of the law: they think of it as some low standard within
their own reach; so they are always endeavouring to fulfil it,
and though always failing, are never really troubled at their
failure; but, when God opens their heart, they discover its
exalted holiness, and find themselves to be nothing better than
dead men before it.&nbsp; This is just what had happened to St.
Paul.&nbsp; He lived in early life as an earnest, religious, and
well-conducted young man, and he was satisfied with
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Touching the righteousness which is in the
law,&rsquo; as he says himself (Phil. iii. 6), he was
&lsquo;blameless.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went through all the Jewish
worship as correctly as possible, and <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>omitted nothing: but he knew nothing
of the claims of the law on his whole heart and all his powers;
he simply regarded it as a collection of rules,&mdash;and he
thought he did well.&nbsp; So he says, in verse nine, &lsquo;I
was alive without the law once.&rsquo;&nbsp; His ignorance of the
law made him think himself alive; but God had after a time opened
his eyes, and he discovered its exalted holiness.&nbsp; He saw it
expounded in the teaching of our Lord, and exhibited in His life;
he found it was nothing less than the perfect will of a perfect
God; and all his own poor, feeble, miserable doings shrank away
as dead things before the holiness of God; and thus he adds,
&lsquo;The commandment came, and I died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now this change had taken place when he wrote the Epistle, so
that the law was no longer to him a mere skeleton of form, but
had appeared before him as the great expression of the mind of
God.&nbsp; And now how did he regard it?&nbsp; This leads to a
second point.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; He approved it, and delighted in it.&nbsp; He
approved it, for he said, &lsquo;I consent unto the law, that it
is good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor did he regard it as a yoke of bondage
about his soul.&nbsp; It was not a rigid code by which he was
forced against his will.&nbsp; <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>How any person can suppose that this
passage is the language of an unregenerate, or unconverted man, I
cannot imagine.&nbsp; Did you ever know an unconverted man to
delight in the perfect holiness of God?&nbsp; Such holiness
condemns, restrains, and frightens him.&nbsp; But St. Paul said,
&lsquo;I delight in the law of God after the inner
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact was he had experienced the great
promise of the New Covenant: &lsquo;I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it on their hearts.&rsquo;&nbsp; God, the
Holy Ghost, had written the law on his heart, and now he loved
it.&nbsp; To please God was his greatest joy, and to do His will
was the chief desire of his soul.&nbsp; He could say, as David
did, &lsquo;Oh, how I love Thy love: it is my meditation all the
day!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was not content with the measure of his own
consciousness, or the standard of his fellow-men, or a vain idea
of doing his best, or doing no harm to any one.&nbsp; He did not
split hairs about the distinction between being blameless and
being faultless.&nbsp; He had seen the Lord in His beauty, and
adored Him in His holiness, so now it was the whole mind and will
of God that filled his soul, and the great desire of his heart
was expressed in such words as those of the Psalmist,
&lsquo;Teach me to do <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Thy will; for Thou art my God: Thy
Spirit is good; lead me into the land of
uprightness.&rsquo;&nbsp; And does not this teach us a lesson of
inexpressible importance respecting ourselves?&nbsp; In Christ
Jesus we are not driven by a slave master, and compelled by the
lash into obedience.&nbsp; We &lsquo;love the law,&rsquo; because
we &lsquo;love the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; We find His will, and His
word, to be dearer unto us than thousands of gold and silver; and
we experience the blessedness described by our blessed Saviour
when He said, &lsquo;Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness, for they shall be filled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But all this while he was painfully conscious that
he was infinitely below its standard.&nbsp; The very fact of
hungering and thirsting after righteousness implies in itself
that your hunger is not yet supplied: so in this passage St. Paul
teaches us that he was still very far from what he most earnestly
desired to be.&nbsp; He felt what I may term the bitter
provocation of shortcoming: &lsquo;The good that I would I do
not, but the evil that I would not that I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
was the unceasing consciousness of falling utterly short of the
high standard set before him in the law.&nbsp; He does not say
this to justify sin, for he <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>tells us how he hated it; but he
teaches us, as plainly as words can teach anything, that at the
very time when God had by His great grace so changed his heart
that he had discovered the law and was delighting in it, there
was still in him what the ninth Article describes, when it says,
&lsquo;The infection of nature doth remain yet in them that are
regenerate.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old, fallen, sinful human nature was
not extinct in him, and this ruin of his fallen nature was acting
as a clog and drawback on his holy longings after the perfect
holiness of God.&nbsp; Thus in his one self there was a contest
between grace and nature, between the new man and the old.&nbsp;
Of the one he says, &lsquo;I delight in the law of God after the
inward man;&rsquo; and of the other, &lsquo;I know that in me
(<i>i.e.</i>, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
By the power of the Holy Ghost he could say, &lsquo;To will is
present with me;&rsquo; but through the power of the old nature
he was obliged to add, &lsquo;How to perform that which is good I
find not.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was this bitter pain of thus failing to
reach the standard of his heart&rsquo;s desire, that drew from
him the cry, &lsquo;Oh, wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
me from the body of this death?&rsquo;&nbsp; Some people think
that such language could not have come <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>from an enlightened believer, led by
the Spirit, and walking in the sunlight of the eighth
chapter.&nbsp; They seem to forget the twenty-third verse of that
very chapter, in which he says, &lsquo;Ourselves also, which have
the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
our body.&rsquo; (viii. 23.)&nbsp; For my own part, I believe it
was the leading of the Spirit that called it forth, inasmuch as
that leading led him to aim at the true standard of the holiness
of God.&nbsp; I agree with the wise commentary of old
Scott:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This energetic language, which many imagine to describe
an unestablished believer&rsquo;s experience, or even that of an
unconverted person, seems to have resulted from the extraordinary
degree of St. Paul&rsquo;s sanctification, and the depth of his
self-abasement, and hatred of sin; and the reason of our not
readily understanding him seems to be that we are so far beneath
him in holiness, humility, acquaintance with the spirituality of
God&rsquo;s law, and the evil of our own hearts, and in our
degree of abhorrence of moral evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have not then the smallest hesitation in taking the passage
as I find it, and regarding it <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>as descriptive of the Apostle&rsquo;s
own sense of shortcoming before the standard of the law, at the
very time of his most peaceful, Christian experience.&nbsp; I
wish I had time to follow out the subject, and show how in the
midst of his conflict a hallowed peace was flowing into his soul:
but that I must leave to another day.&nbsp; But you must not wait
till next Sunday, seeking peace, and finding none; you must
remember at once that, though you fail, the Lord Jesus Christ
never does.&nbsp; You must remember at once that it is with
especial reference to this very struggle that we are taught that
&lsquo;the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all
sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; You must remember at once that in the midst of
all your difficulties you have a living Advocate at the right
hand of God; and therefore at once, with God&rsquo;s holiness as
your standard, God&rsquo;s atonement as your righteousness, and
God&rsquo;s Spirit as your guide, notwithstanding all
shortcomings, you may say as St. Paul did in the midst of his
struggle, &lsquo;I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>GRACE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&nbsp; So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God;
but with the flesh the law of sin.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rom</span>. vii. 25.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which
are in Jesus Christ, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rom</span>. viii. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">hope</span> that your study of this
passage during the week has confirmed the conclusions at which we
arrived last Sunday,&mdash;that St. Paul was speaking of himself,
not of another; and that he was describing his experience at the
very time he wrote the Epistle.&nbsp; I trust also you have seen
from his words that the Lord had opened his eyes to discover the
holiness of the law, and changed his heart, so that with his
whole soul he loved it.&nbsp; I hope also that it has been clear
to you that this exclamation, &lsquo;Oh, wretched man that I
am!&rsquo; was the expression of his profound humiliation, under
the painful <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>sense of his own shortcoming when measured by the high
standard of the holiness of God.</p>
<p>Now, I believe that if, instead of adopting some artificial
standard of our own, we aim at the perfection of God&rsquo;s
holiness, as taught in the Word of God and exhibited in the life
of the Son of God, we are sure thus painfully to feel the
contrast between what we are and what we ought to be.&nbsp; Of
course if we measure ourselves by ourselves we may be easily
satisfied; but then we know we are not wise, and our satisfaction
may be nothing more than delusion.&nbsp; But if we bring
ourselves to the test of perfect, spotless, eternal holiness, and
honestly look into the workings of our own fallen heart, I cannot
imagine why we should shrink from such words as those in our
confession, &lsquo;We have left undone those things which we
ought to have done, and we have done those things which we ought
not to have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Are we to understand then that there is nothing but conflict
and disappointment before the Christian man, and that the only
effect of the opening of the heart by the Holy Ghost, is to lead
us to discover, and feel the pain of, sin?&nbsp; If so, I could
almost say, &lsquo;Let the eye <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>remain closed,&rsquo; for I verily
believe there is no state of mind so painful as when there is the
sight of sin without the sight of Christ Jesus.&nbsp; When you
know neither sin nor a Saviour, you can be content in the world;
when you know sin alone without a Saviour, you have all the
anxiety of religion without the joy: but it is when you know
both, that you may be sorrowful yet always rejoicing; deeply
conscious of your own defects, and yet resting peacefully in the
right hand of the blessed Lord who has redeemed you by His
blood.</p>
<p>This morning, therefore, if God permit, we will endeavour to
study what it is in the Saviour that can give us a peaceful,
thankful joy, at the very time that we feel most profoundly
humbled before the holiness of God.&nbsp; I have not nearly time
to discuss the whole subject as I should like to do, and,
therefore, must confine your attention to these two verses;
standing as they do in immediate connexion with the description
of the struggle, they will supply us with exactly the information
we require, and teach us how in the midst of the sharpest
conflict with sin the believer may enjoy the most perfect peace
in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>There
appear to be three lessons plainly taught us.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; We have the triumphant hope of final victory.&nbsp;
Along with the deepest sense of unsatisfied longings after
holiness there is the peaceful spirit of thanksgiving in the
assurance of a coming triumph.&nbsp; The passage does not refer
to a deliverance that had already taken place, but to one still
future; and the thanksgiving was not for any thing past, but for
a great work still remaining to be accomplished.&nbsp; So the
deliverance from the text is not a deliverance from the curse,
for that had taken place already; nor a deliverance from the
sentence of the law, for from that the Apostle was already free;
but a deliverance from the power of indwelling sin, which kept
him back from the holiness at which he aimed.&nbsp; He said,
therefore, &lsquo;Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?&rsquo;&nbsp; He had found by experience that he could not
deliver himself; but in the midst of his own failure he could
look up to the great Deliverer, and with profound thanksgiving
bless God for the undoubting assurance that in God&rsquo;s own
time he would be completely <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>transformed into the very likeness of
his Lord.&nbsp; His language is explained by his own words, in
Phil. iii. 20, 21: &lsquo;From whence also we look for the
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according
to the working whereby He is able to subdue all things to
Himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The body of this death,&rsquo; in
the text, is the same as the &lsquo;vile body,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;body of humiliation,&rsquo; in the Philippians; and the
deliverance of the text is the transformation of that body into
the likeness of the Lord Christ Jesus, at the appearing of our
Blessed Saviour.&nbsp; This is exactly the same as what the
Apostle John expected when he said (1 John, iii. 2),
&lsquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear,
we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So that, on the whole, we are taught that the time is most
undoubtedly coming when those who are thirsting after the
holiness of God will be perfectly satisfied; when the vile body
shall be changed; and when not a spot, or blemish, will remain in
any one of the saints of God.</p>
<p>Ye then who are humbled and cast down <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>because of
your infinite shortcomings, ye must not be disheartened, but must
trust your Saviour.&nbsp; He came to save His people from their
sins, and in His own time He will do it.&nbsp; If you be in Him,
He has already set you free from the curse; He has already given
you the earnest desire to do His will; He has already so far
secured the victory that, &lsquo;Sin shall not have the dominion
over you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the time is soon coming when He will
Himself appear in His glory, and then all conflicts will be over,
and you will be like Him, for you shall see Him as He is.&nbsp;
Like St. Paul, therefore, you may begin at once to give Him
thanks.&nbsp; You remember the case of Jehoshaphat, and how he
put the singers in front of his little army, to praise God for
the promised victory, even when the enemy stood there in the
fulness of his strength.&nbsp; So you too may rise at once in the
spirit of thanksgiving: for in Christ Jesus your victory is far
more certain than that of Jehoshaphat.&nbsp; You may press on,
therefore, with the utmost vigour, with a victory full in view;
and, though as yet you fall infinitely short of His most perfect
character, you need not wait till you have overcome your
difficulties, <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>but may even now say, as St. Paul did, &lsquo;I thank
God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But you could not do this if all the while the power
of sin were shutting you out from God.&nbsp; And this leads us to
a second point of the utmost possible importance: viz., that now,
in the midst of the struggle, and during the time of
imperfection, in Christ Jesus we are free from all
condemnation.&nbsp; If, as we pursue our course, we were to be
condemned for all the sin of which we are guilty in either
omission or commission, in either thought, word, or act, there
could be no peace or hope in our struggle.&nbsp; I am not
surprised that poor people who do not know the Gospel go to
priests for absolution, or resort to any other man-made expedient
in order to endeavour to escape from the misery of the perpetual
exclusion from God of which they must be conscious.&nbsp; But in
Christ Jesus you need nothing of the kind, for &lsquo;there is
now no condemnation for them that are in Christ
Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp; Observe the force of the &lsquo;now&rsquo; in
contrast with the &lsquo;shall&rsquo; of the twenty-fourth verse
of the seventh chapter.&nbsp; The complete deliverance is future:
so he said, &lsquo;Who <i>shall</i> <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>deliver me?&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
perfect freedom from all condemnation is present: and therefore
he says, &lsquo;There is <i>now</i> no condemnation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The &lsquo;therefore now&rsquo; of that verse depends on the
sixth verse of the seventh chapter, the intermediate passage
being a parenthesis, so that the connexion is as follows:
&lsquo;Now we are delivered from the law, . . . there is
therefore now no condemnation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The battle is not
over, and you have still to fight a hard fight with sin; but now
that sin cannot cut you off from God, for you are no longer under
the law: you are in Christ Jesus, and He has satisfied the law in
your behalf.&nbsp; Your sin undoubtedly deserves condemnation,
and you have not a word to say in its defence: but He has already
borne that condemnation, so that in Him you are free; and nothing
can separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
the Lord.&nbsp; Now, think for one moment of the unspeakable
blessedness of this most precious truth.&nbsp; You may review all
that has occurred through the day,&mdash;your prayers, your
praises, your wandering thoughts, your conversation, your
motives, and your heart&rsquo;s desires,&mdash;and oh, how far
they will all fall short of the holiness of God!&nbsp; If you <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>are not in
Christ Jesus, the thought of them must fill you with anxiety,
doubt, and a sense of distance from God; but if you are enabled
by His grace to take home to your heart the blessed truth, that
<i>now</i>, even <i>now</i>, before you have gained the victory,
there is no condemnation,&mdash;then that sin does not separate
you from Him.&nbsp; It humbles you, it is true, and deeply
grieves you; but it cannot cut you off from God: you are
sheltered in the covenant of Grace.&nbsp; &lsquo;The blood of
Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth you from all sin,&rsquo; and you
may kneel before Him in the peaceful enjoyment of a true and
uninterrupted fellowship with God.&nbsp; In the spirit of
adoption you may cry Abba, Father; and with the happy trust of a
child in its father&rsquo;s arms, you may say, &lsquo;I will lay
me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell
in safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But that is not all; for besides this we have the
unspeakable privilege of the unceasing leading of God the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; If we were left to ourselves to fight out our battle
with sin, to rely on our own judgment, and to overcome by our own
powers, we should be <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>overcome before we had struck a
single blow.&nbsp; But not only is there a final victory promised
to us in the future, and a complete freedom from all condemnation
in the present, but there is also another most sacred gift at
once enjoyed by all who are in Christ Jesus: viz., the present
indwelling of God the Holy Ghost within the soul.&nbsp; This
belongs not to the future, but to the present: it is not
connected with the &lsquo;shall&rsquo; of verse twenty-four, but
with the &lsquo;now&rsquo; of verse one.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is
now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who
walk,&rsquo; or who are walking, &lsquo;not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, in verse fourteen, we read of
a present leading as the privilege of a present sonship:
&lsquo;As many as are led,&rsquo; or being led, &lsquo;by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
impossible to attempt to unfold all the blessings which follow
from this most sacred privilege: it conveys to us all that is
connected both with companionship and power.&nbsp; Companionship,
because He is not one afar off to be reached only occasionally,
and that after special efforts: but dwelling within the soul as a
Leader, a Comforter, a Witness, an Advocate, a Friend.&nbsp; And
a power: for He is not like a <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>mighty arm afar off, omnipotent if we
could but reach it; but a very present help: one that knows our
weakness better than we do, and perceives our danger before we
know it ourselves.&nbsp; One that, dwelling within, can so act on
the conscience, and so move the secret springs of the will, that
He does not merely make use of us as machines, but constrains us
to hate sin and to love holiness; while He Himself imparts a
power to shake off our fetters, and as free men to walk with
God.</p>
<p>Surely, then, we may understand the apparent contradiction in
the Apostle&rsquo;s words, and see why it was that he was
thanking God, although he called himself a wretched man.&nbsp; He
called himself a wretched man, because there was that in his
ruined nature which kept him back from the exalted holiness at
which he aimed: but he could still thank God, for he was sure
that before long he would be transformed into the likeness of
Christ Himself; and, more than that, he knew that even now, in
the days of his conflict, there was a freedom from all
condemnation for his failures, and the sacred assurance of the
Holy Ghost abiding in his soul to lead him on <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>to
victory.&nbsp; Therefore it was that he could give thanks.&nbsp;
And, dear brethren, if you are in Christ Jesus, may not you do
the same?&nbsp; Is there not the same hope for you?&nbsp; Are not
you equally free from condemnation?&nbsp; Is not the indwelling
Spirit equally effectual for you?&nbsp; How is it then that your
whole souls are not filled with bright hope, and profound
thanksgiving?&nbsp; How is it that we do not all unite more
heartily and unreservedly in the spirit of the text, &lsquo;I
thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord?&rsquo;</p>

90</span>HOLINESS THROUGH FAITH.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And put no difference between us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Acts</span>, xv. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">fear</span> that I may have almost
wearied some of you by dwelling so long as I have on the subject
of sanctification, or Christian holiness; but it is one of such
overwhelming practical importance, and so intimately connected
with the glory of God, that I am persuaded we ought none to
grudge any time spent on the study of it.&nbsp; I must ask your
attention, therefore, to a phrase which has lately become
familiar to some of you, viz. &lsquo;holiness through
faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; I like the expression thoroughly, and believe
it to be full of truth; for there can be no true holiness except
by faith, and no real faith that does not lead to holiness.&nbsp;
If we are holy at all we may be perfectly certain that the
holiness will be through faith; and if we are real believers we
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>may be
equally sure that we shall be holy; therefore it is that in this
passage, when the Apostle is speaking of the sacred work of
divine purity wrought in the soul by the Holy Ghost, he described
Him as &lsquo;purifying the heart by faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
then shall be our subject for this morning, and I hope we may
learn two great truths: first, that holiness is not known by
faith; and next, that faith is the power by which it pleases God
to produce holiness in the soul.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Holiness is not known by faith.&nbsp; This seems so
obvious that it may be scarcely thought to require consideration,
but from what I have read lately, I am inclined to think it
does.&nbsp; Let us then bear well in mind that faith is entirely
occupied with things future or unseen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Faith is the
substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen.&rsquo;&nbsp; The moment that we can see anything, that
thing ceases to be an object of faith.&nbsp; There is an old
saying, that &lsquo;seeing is believing;&rsquo; but that is the
creed of the materialist, who says he can only believe what he
sees; but it will not do for the Christian, or even for the
philosopher, for sight supersedes faith, and the very essence of
faith is to <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>believe when we cannot see.&nbsp; So our Lord said to
Thomas, &lsquo;Blessed are they which have not seen, and yet have
believed.&rsquo;&nbsp; You believe that the Lord Jesus is now at
the right hand of the Father, and will shortly come again; but
when you stand before Him and behold Him on His throne, it will
no longer be a matter of faith, but of sight.&nbsp; So our
justification through imputed righteousness is a matter of faith:
it is a divine act of the hidden mind of God, and perfectly
invisible to the eye of man.&nbsp; You cannot see your name in
the book of life; you cannot see the counsel of God blotting out
your sin because of the finished sacrifice, or accounting you
righteous in Christ Jesus even at the very time that you know
yourself to be a ruined sinner.&nbsp; You cannot see it, for the
whole transaction is out of sight: it takes place in heaven, not
on earth; in the council-chamber of God, and not within the reach
of human vision.&nbsp; This, therefore, is an object of faith,
and can only be known by faith.&nbsp; You cannot hope to see your
justification, or the imputation of righteousness to your soul;
all that you can do is to trust God for it.&nbsp; He has declared
in His Word that He has &lsquo;made Him who knew no <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>sin to be sin
for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that we may trust in His assurance, and
believe that, the Lord Jesus having been made sin for us, we are
accounted righteous in Him, even with the righteousness of
God.&nbsp; Yes: and thanks be to God! we may believe it at once,
for the Covenant of God is as perfect now as it can be if we wait
a hundred years.&nbsp; There is nothing, therefore, to prevent a
present and immediate faith in the finished Work, and perfect
Word, of a Blessed Saviour.&nbsp; Believe Him, and there is
peace; and believe Him now.</p>
<p>But it is not so with sanctification, or holiness.&nbsp; The
seat of holiness, or sanctification, is in our own souls.&nbsp;
It is not like the name written in the Book of Life which no man
can see; for it is the law written by the Holy Ghost upon the
fleshy tables of the heart, and therefore within view of
conscience.&nbsp; God has placed a conscience within every one of
us: an eye that looks inward, and can see all that is passing
within the soul.&nbsp; Are there bad acts, bad words, or bad
thoughts?&nbsp; Conscience may see them all.&nbsp; Is there a
deep desire to walk with God, and do His Will?&nbsp; Conscience
discovers it.&nbsp; So says <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the Apostle John (1 John, iii. 20,
21): &lsquo;If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our
heart, and knoweth all things.&nbsp; Beloved, if our heart
condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Conscience therefore must decide as to the existence of
sanctification, or personal holiness.&nbsp; Justification, or
imputed righteousness, is known by faith, not sight:
sanctification, or inwrought righteousness, is known by sight,
not faith.&nbsp; We should be acting in unbelief if we were to
doubt the perfection of imputed righteousness because we cannot
see it, for faith is concerned with the unseen; but we should be
putting faith into altogether a false position if we were to
presume to believe in the perfection of our holiness so long as
conscience convinces us that sin is still abiding in the
heart.&nbsp; If we are conscious of indwelling sin, and find it
ready to break out like a fire at any moment, it is not the
office of faith to reckon it dead.&nbsp; No, dear brethren: true
holiness is a practical change of heart wrought in us by the Holy
Ghost, and perceptible; it is a new character wrought in us by a
new power, and springing from new principles.&nbsp; It is not an
invisible change, but one known by its results; it is not a <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>matter of
faith, but of experience; and so St. John says in his Epistle (1
John, iii. 24): &lsquo;Hereby we know that He abideth in us, by
the Spirit which He hath given us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But, though holiness is not known by faith, faith is
the power by which it pleases God to produce it, and therefore it
is well called &lsquo;Holiness through faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some
people seem to speak of this subject as if they had made a great
religious discovery.&nbsp; I often wonder what books they had
read, or what sermons they had heard, before they discovered
it.&nbsp; They could not have been those of the great divines of
the Church of England,&mdash;such as Hooker, Bishop Reynolds, or
Archbishop Leighton; nor of the great Evangelical Fathers in the
Church of England,&mdash;such as Venn, Cecil, and Simeon; for
holiness through faith is the keynote of all their
writings.&nbsp; Over and over again have sermons been preached
and books written on such great, full, plain texts as this:
&lsquo;Put no difference between us and them, purifying their
hearts by faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, leaving such discussions, let us consider the office of
faith in producing holiness, and <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>examine in what way it pleases God to
purify the heart through faith.</p>
<p>We shall find that He does it in two ways.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; By the introduction of new motives and
principles.&nbsp; He does not deal with us as though we were
without mind, but by the use of the mind which He Himself has
given.&nbsp; The refiner refines the silver, but the silver has
no voice in the transaction: it is simply acted upon as lifeless
matter.&nbsp; But it is not so with the soul: the soul can think,
can feel, can sorrow, can rejoice, can love; and when God refines
it He calls into activity all its faculties.&nbsp; In purifying
the heart He makes use of its powers, and so consecrates them to
His most sacred service.&nbsp; For example, there is no greater
power in the whole mind of man than love.&nbsp; People will make
any sacrifices under the influence of a powerful affection; God
therefore takes that faculty of love, and so consecrates it to
His own sacred service, that the people of God may say,
&lsquo;The love of Christ constraineth us.&rsquo;&nbsp; And now
you see in a moment the office of faith.&nbsp; How is that love
to grow up within the soul if there be no faith preceding
it?&nbsp; If you have no trust in His reconciling grace,&mdash;if
it is all a <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>matter of uncertainty to you whether He is loving you as
a child, or about to cast you as a condemned criminal into
hell,&mdash;I cannot see what there is to call forth any love
within your heart.&nbsp; St. John says, &lsquo;We love Him
because He first loved us;&rsquo; so that if there is no trust in
His first love the motive is gone, and there is no power by which
love in us can be produced.&nbsp; But when, on the other hand, we
can believe His boundless grace,&mdash;believe that He gave
Himself to be sin for us with as little doubt as if we actually
saw Him on the cross,&mdash;believe that we are already forgiven
through His blood, and, though so unworthy, made the
righteousness of God in Him,&mdash;believe, in short, that He is
fulfilling to us that most precious promise in Hosea, &lsquo;I
will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from
him,&rsquo; and all because the Son of God was content in our
place to die,&mdash;then there is something to call forth love in
the hardest heart that ever beat; something that must make sin in
all its forms inexpressibly hateful; something to produce those
sacred results of constraining love described by St. Paul, when
he said, &lsquo;That they which live should not henceforth live
unto themselves, <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>but unto Him that died for them, and rose
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If therefore you earnestly desire holiness, remember it must
be holiness through faith.&nbsp; Do not fall into the common
error of supposing it must be faith through holiness; but keep
close to what is taught you in the text: viz., that God purifies
the heart through faith.&nbsp; First, get a fast hold on His love
to you.&nbsp; Realise that, and you may safely leave your love to
Him to follow.&nbsp; But, till you know that, you will never be
really holy, for you can never be under the power of the great
governing principle of love.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But this is not all, for true holiness is a Divine
gift as much as pardon.&nbsp; It is not an uncommon thing to find
a kind of vague idea that we are to find the holiness, and God
the pardon; the certain result of which is that there is no
progress in the one, and no joy in the other.&nbsp; But that is
not the teaching of the Gospel.&nbsp; According to the Sacred
Scripture all the Three Persons of the one Godhead are engaged in
our sanctification.&nbsp; In this passage, <i>e.g.</i>, it is
ascribed to God the Father, as its author, and God the Holy Ghost
as the agent; in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, our Lord
and <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>Saviour is said to be &lsquo;made unto us
sanctification:&rsquo; so that He bears the very title of Jesus,
because it is His office to &lsquo;save His people from their
sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, therefore, we are made holy, it is by the
power of the Holy Ghost carrying out the purpose of the Father,
and dwelling within the soul through the mediation of the Son; it
is the sacred act of Divine power carrying into effect the Divine
Covenant through the mediatorial work of the Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; And here you see in a moment the office of
faith.&nbsp; Faith is the act of the soul casting itself on the
Covenant, and on the Lord Jesus Christ revealed in Scripture as
the Mediator of the Covenant.&nbsp; If you fight your own battle
for holiness you may struggle hard, and struggle long, but you
are sure to fail.&nbsp; You may try any expedient you
please,&mdash;rules of life, books of self-examination, anything;
but it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; The old sin of your fallen heart
will keep cropping up just as strong as ever; and you will find
yourself a year hence no nearer to the mark than you are now, for
the holiness at which you are aiming is not holiness through
faith.&nbsp; If you thirst for holiness, you must throw yourself
into the arms of the Son of God, that He, by the mighty power of
the Holy <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Ghost, may do that which you cannot do,&mdash;make you
holy; or, according to the text, purify your heart by
faith.&nbsp; There is a great danger of our being partial in our
trust: of trusting Him for pardon, but not for holiness.&nbsp;
But He teaches us to trust Him equally for both.&nbsp; The
promise, &lsquo;I will put my law into their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts,&rsquo; is just as much a promise of the
Covenant as that other promise, &lsquo;I will forgive their
iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You may therefore trust Him to write His law on your heart just
as much as you may trust Him for the forgiveness of your sin.</p>
<p>It does not follow from this that the two gifts will be
completed at the same time, or in the same way: the writing of
the law on the heart is through a gradual process of Divine
education; the blotting out of sin, an immediate act complete at
once in the mind of God: but both are acts of the great
Deliverer, and for both equally it is the joy of our hearts to
trust Him.&nbsp; Trust Him, therefore, to work out a holiness in
your soul just as you trust Him to have given you the forgiveness
of your sin.&nbsp; If you are trusting Him for imputed
righteousness,&mdash;<a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>that is, trusting Him for having
wrought out such a work in your behalf that you are already
&lsquo;made the righteousness of God in Him,&rsquo;&mdash;trust
Him also for personal holiness; that by the power of the Holy
Ghost your character may be conformed to your position.&nbsp;
There are many powers by which you may gain many victories, but
there is only one by which you can overcome the world: viz., that
described by St. John when he said, &lsquo;This is the victory
that over-cometh the world, even our faith.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be sure,
then, that that power is sufficient; so that, trusting Christ,
you may rest assured of victory.&nbsp; You are not condemned to
toil on in a condition of disheartening hopelessness; but you may
enter on each day of your life in the happy and peaceful
assurance, not that you are perfect, but that you have
perpetually at hand a loving Lord fully able by His own
omnipotence to overcome in you your besetting sin.&nbsp; So you
may go up from the wilderness leaning on the Beloved, and by
God&rsquo;s grace may walk with Him to victory.&nbsp; Past
failures must teach you your own most terrible corruption; but
God&rsquo;s truth may assure you of His sufficiency: so that at
the very moment of your own most utter helplessness, <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>when you
are ready to cry, &lsquo;Oh, wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?&rsquo; you may reply to
your own question in the triumphant language of the Apostle,
&lsquo;I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>CONSECRATION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rom</span>. xii. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <span class="smcap">great</span> deal has been lately said
on the subject of consecration; and we may all rejoice in having
our attention directed to it, as we all require a much higher
standard than we have ever yet known of self-abandoning
dedication to the Lord.&nbsp; We all need to know more fully and
more experimentally the real meaning of such words as these:
&lsquo;Whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or whether we die,
we die unto the Lord; whether we live, therefore, or die, we are
the Lord&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is most important then that we
understand what we mean by consecration.&nbsp; It is clearly
quite distinct from that Divine act of separation in which God,
by the power of the <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Holy Ghost, separates His own elect,
and incorporates them into Christ.&nbsp; It is also quite
distinct from the submission of the soul when it ceases to go
about to establish its own righteousness, and submits itself unto
the righteousness of God, though in the inaccurate phraseology of
some modern writings it sometimes appears to be confounded with
it.&nbsp; To consecrate any thing is to set it apart as a holy
gift unto the Lord; and, therefore, when we speak of
consecration, or self-consecration, we mean that which St. Paul
described of the Churches of Macedonia, when he said, &lsquo;They
first gave their own selves to the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the
voluntary act of the loving and believing heart yielding itself
up to a blessed Saviour, to be henceforth holy unto God.&nbsp; It
is in this sense that I am about to speak of it now,&mdash;not
considering the word so much as the thing,&mdash;and hoping that,
by God&rsquo;s great grace, all amongst us who know the Lord may
be enabled to yield ourselves, as we have never yet done, to His
service.</p>
<p>There are few passages of sacred Scripture which will give us
a better summary of the subject than this verse.&nbsp; It
contains four points, to which I would draw your particular
attention.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>I.&nbsp; This consecration is a sacrifice.&nbsp; I need
not say that it is not a sacrifice for the blotting out of sin:
it cost more to redeem our souls, so we must let that alone for
ever.&nbsp; It is the sacrifice of thanksgiving, corresponding to
the meat-offering in the law of types,&mdash;the sacrifice of the
thankful heart presenting its thank-offering to God.&nbsp;
Regarding it then as prefigured by the meat-offering, we may
learn two lessons respecting it.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It implies complete surrender.&nbsp; Under the
ancient law every sacrifice was wholly given up to God.&nbsp;
Whatever was brought to the altar was given up without
reserve.&nbsp; No part of it was taken back to the home of the
offerer.&nbsp; People might give what they pleased, but when it
was given it was no longer their own, but God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
so it is with us.&nbsp; If we have given ourselves to the Lord,
we are no longer our own: &lsquo;Whether we live or die, we are
the Lord&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is, however, this difference
between the Jewish sacrifice and ours.&nbsp; In the case of the
ancient sacrifices, when the sacrifice was a living animal, it
was always put to death, and part of it burned as a sweet savour
unto God: but it is not so with us.&nbsp; According to <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>this text,
it is a living sacrifice that we are called to offer; it is the
continued life that we are to surrender.&nbsp; We are not now
called to die for Him, as martyrs and many of our missionaries
have done, but to live for Him in that state of life in which it
has pleased God to call us.&nbsp; The sweet savour that is to
rise from our sacrifice is to be the sweet savour of Christian
holiness, the holy fragrance of Christian character.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; This sacrifice is well pleasing to God.&nbsp; The
meat-offering was described as &lsquo;an offering made by fire of
a sweet savour unto the Lord:&rsquo; so this sacrifice is said in
the text to be &lsquo;acceptable unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It does
not say that it can fulfil the law, or be perfect before God; for
there is a vast difference between that which can fulfil the law
and that which can please Him.&nbsp; Nothing imperfect can fulfil
the law, but the utterly imperfect service of a loving heart may
be well-pleasing in His sight.&nbsp; Thus it is that He declares
our sacrifice to be acceptable to Himself; and while we seek to
yield all we have to Him, and for His sake &lsquo;to do good and
to communicate,&rsquo; we may have the delight and encouragement
of knowing that &lsquo;with such sacrifices God is well
pleased.&rsquo; (Heb. xiii. 16.)</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>II.&nbsp; It is a sacrifice of the whole man.&nbsp; In
the first verse the body only is mentioned: &lsquo;Present your
bodies a living sacrifice;&rsquo; which evidently has reference
to the Jewish type, and teaches that we are not to offer the body
of a lamb, or a goat, or a heifer, but our own.&nbsp; But the
next verse teaches us that the appeal is not limited to the
offering of the body, for there we read that we are to be
&lsquo;transformed by the renewing of our <i>mind</i>, that we
may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that the whole man is
to be included in the gift.&nbsp; Now I sometimes meet with
subtle distinctions between the soul and the spirit, and the
emotions and the will, and I am quite ready to admit that they
may be all correct and very interesting: but I do not care to
stop to distinguish between the different parts or faculties, for
God&rsquo;s call lays claim to them all.&nbsp; Whatever they are,
and whereinsoever they differ, the desire of our heart should be
that they should all as one whole be given up to Him.&nbsp; In
whatever position He has placed us,&mdash;whether that of
parents, children, masters, servants, men of business, men of
wealth, tradesmen, labourers, or clergymen,&mdash;that position
is <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>to be
occupied for Him; and whatever faculties He has given
us,&mdash;whether a powerful intellect, a good memory, a warm
heart, a tender conscience, a vigorous body, a good constitution,
or an ample fortune,&mdash;all, all belong to Him who has
redeemed us by His own most precious blood.&nbsp; When we give up
ourselves we give up everything,&mdash;our wills, and emotions,
and powers, and energies, our hearts, and heads, and
hands,&mdash;to be yielded up to Him, and employed by Him and for
Him, as He sees best for His own glory.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; This consecration is the result of mercy.&nbsp; The
latter words of the text show that it is &lsquo;a reasonable
service;&rsquo; or, in other words, that it is not the result of
mere feeling, impulse, or emotion, but the deliberate and
well-considered decision of a thoughtful mind.&nbsp; The passage
corresponds to those words in 2 Cor. v. 14: &lsquo;The love of
Christ constraineth us because we thus judge;&rsquo; where you
see the union between the heart and the head.&nbsp; The
constraining love is the result of the judgment, the blessed
fruit of the deep convictions of the understanding: so that those
who feel it may give a reason, not only for the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>hope that
is in them, but also for the love that fills their heart.&nbsp;
There are certain great facts on which the judgment rests, and
the believing assurance of these facts is the means employed by
the Holy Spirit to call forth the devotedness of love.</p>
<p>Now what are these facts?&nbsp; What is it that possesses this
love-producing power?&nbsp; In the passage from the Corinthians
there is one great fact mentioned: viz., the propitiatory death
of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; &lsquo;If one died for all, then
were all dead,&rsquo; &lsquo;or died.&rsquo;&nbsp; They died in
Him, inasmuch as they were represented by Him; and it is that
great fact which is said to produce the constraining love.&nbsp;
In this passage no one fact is mentioned, but the appeal is made
to the whole multitude of His mercies: &lsquo;I beseech you,
therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a
living sacrifice.&rsquo;&nbsp; Throughout the Epistle St. Paul
had been showing that we are all saved by mercy.&nbsp; In the
eleventh chapter he had enlarged on the mercy by which we
Gentiles are now saved in Christ Jesus and the mercy about to be
manifested towards the Jews, till he arrives at the conclusion
that &lsquo;God hath concluded all in unbelief, that He might
have mercy upon all.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Then he bursts forth in the
exclamation, &lsquo;Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
and knowledge of God!&rsquo; and follows it up by the appeal of
the text: &lsquo;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
mercies of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; If such mercy has been shown you,
if, notwithstanding all your unbelief, by boundless and unmerited
mercy you have been saved and made one even with Christ Himself,
is it now too much to ask of you that, without delay and without
reserve, you yield your whole lives to His service?</p>
<p>I believe it is impossible for us to be too careful in
observing this connexion between consecration and mercy, for in
the very vague theology of the present day there is a great deal
which certainly has the appearance of teaching that the blessed
peace of a union with Christ is to be the result of entire
consecration.&nbsp; But we are here taught, not that we are to
reach mercy as the result of the completeness of our
consecration, but that, having realized mercy, we should yield
ourselves in consecration to God.&nbsp; That union with the Lord
Jesus must be given through the personal appropriation of the
mercy of God in Him; and we should regard with the utmost
jealousy any teaching which, <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>either intentionally or
unintentionally, turns the thoughts inwards to analyze the extent
of consecration, with a view to obtaining the blessing of that
union, instead of rather diverting all thoughts to the fulness of
mercy in Christ Jesus, and so calling forth out of His fulness
the abounding love of a consecrated heart.</p>
<p>This great truth is well brought out in our Communion
Service.&nbsp; You remember those words of self-consecration in
which we have so often united, words founded on this very text:
&lsquo;Here we offer and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves,
our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively
sacrifice unto Thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now in the first Prayer-book of
Edward VI. that prayer stood before the reception of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, as if we were first to complete an act of
self-consecration, and then upon the strength of it feed on
Christ: so our Reformers changed its position, and put the prayer
after the reception instead of before it, in order to show that
when we want to feed on Christ Jesus, to dwell in Him and He in
us, we must come to His footstool as poor sinners, forgiven and
accepted through His most precious blood; and that when we have
been thus permitted to &lsquo;sit <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>under His shadow with great delight,
and to find His fruit sweet to our taste,&rsquo; the next thing
for us all to do is to kneel down with a full and thankful heart,
and yield ourselves, body, soul, and spirit, to His service.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; This consecration should be continually renewed and
deepened.&nbsp; In our Communion Service we renew our
self-dedication every time that we receive the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, for every time we say the same words: &lsquo;Here we
offer and present ourselves . . . to be a reasonable, holy, and
lively sacrifice unto Thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; In doing this I firmly
believe we are right; and that we are so seems clearly proved by
the text.&nbsp; The Romans, to whom these words were addressed,
were &lsquo;beloved of God, called to be saints&rsquo; (i. 7);
they had &lsquo;become servants of God&rsquo; and had
&lsquo;their fruit unto holiness.&rsquo; (vi. 22.)&nbsp; There
can be no doubt, therefore, as to their past surrender to His
service; but, notwithstanding that, they were exhorted afresh to
&lsquo;present their bodies a living sacrifice,&rsquo; and afresh
to &lsquo;yield themselves unto God.&rsquo; (vi. 13.)&nbsp; So we
are not to look on our consecration as a single act, completed at
a certain moment, and afterwards to be regarded <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>as a
finished thing; but rather as a habit and attitude of mind,
deepening with our depth, strengthening with our strength, and
growing with our growth.&nbsp; As we grow in grace and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we shall grow
also in the deep sense of mercy.&nbsp; His love passeth
knowledge, and it will take eternity to learn its fulness.&nbsp;
And His mercy corresponds with His love: it is &lsquo;from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him;&rsquo; it is
&lsquo;high as the heaven is above the earth;&rsquo; and as no
astronomer can measure the height of the fixed stars, and as no
finite mind can take in the idea of an infinite eternity, so none
of us, no, not even the most advanced believer, can fathom the
depths or scan the heights of the free, unfettered, everlasting
mercy of our God.&nbsp; But as we grow in the knowledge of Him
and of ourselves, we shall learn more and more of it.&nbsp; The
more we know of the covenant of God,&mdash;the more we see of the
Lord Jesus, in His person, His character, and His work,&mdash;the
more we know of our own hearts, and discover the exceeding
sinfulness of our ruined nature, and the more we see of the
perfect adaptation to our utmost wants of the Divine salvation
wrought <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>out for us in Christ Jesus,&mdash;so much the more
shall we know of mercy.&nbsp; Every day in the believer&rsquo;s
life brings with it a fresh lesson in mercy, and every prayer
that we pray to a reconciled Father should bring home to us with
fresh power the deep debt we owe to mercy.</p>
<p>And now you see in a moment how it is that there should be a
continued and constantly repeated renewal of
self-consecration.&nbsp; Every fresh discovery of mercy should
lead at once to fresh surrender.&nbsp; If you are looking on
mercy as some distant thing, which you have often heard of and
wish to reach, but cannot, I see not, for my part, how it should
have any great power over your life; for, though it looks very
beautiful, you cannot say that it has brought any benefit to
you.&nbsp; If you have never felt your own deep need of it, and
never learned your utter ruin, and have therefore never realised
your condemnation before God, I see not how the tidings of mercy
should have any great power upon you, for no man really cares for
the remedy until he has been taught by God&rsquo;s Spirit to feel
his need.&nbsp; But if you have discovered yourself to be utterly
and hopelessly lost, condemned alike by your own conscience and
by the law of God; and if in the <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>midst of your ruin you have, by
God&rsquo;s rich love in Christ Jesus, &lsquo;obtained
mercy;&rsquo; if you can look on His mercy in having redeemed you
by His blood, in having called you by His Spirit, in having saved
you by His grace, in having given you a blessed hope of His
everlasting kingdom,&mdash;then indeed I cannot doubt that God
has long since called you to a real consecration to His
service.&nbsp; But if this be so, and if God has since been
bringing you to a deeper sense of sin, and at the same time
opening your heart to understand more of His mercy; if He is step
by step making manifest to you &lsquo;the depth, and length, and
breadth, and height,&rsquo; and causing you to &lsquo;know the
love of Christ that passeth knowledge:&rsquo; then I can see very
clearly that all past consecration must appear to your own heart
as nothing, and that, &lsquo;forgetting those things that are
behind, and reaching forth unto those things that are
before,&rsquo; you will be ready again to kneel down at His feet,
and with fresh love and fresh thanksgiving, yield yourselves
afresh to Him, to be His, and His for ever.&nbsp; You may have
long since given yourself to the Lord; but if you are this day
really permitted &lsquo;to feed on Him&mdash;in your
heart&mdash;by faith&mdash;with thanksgiving, <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>you will be
prepared to kneel down afterwards and say, &lsquo;Here we offer
and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies to
be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto Thee.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>PRAYER.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am Thine, save me; for I have sought Thy
precepts.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxix.
94.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> studied last Sunday the subject
of consecration as taught us in the words of the Apostle Paul, in
which he exhorted us to &lsquo;present our bodies a living
sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; I trust the
result has been that many amongst us have so realised the
multitude of God&rsquo;s mercies that, under the deep sense of
profound thanksgiving, we have knelt down before Him, afresh to
yield ourselves to His service.&nbsp; If so, the question arises,
What next?&nbsp; If the sacrifice of ourselves has been offered
by us and accepted by God, into what position have we been
brought, and what are we to expect in our future life?&nbsp; Are
we to expect to be so set free from the impediments of sin, and
so filled with holy love and joy that we shall be gently <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>wafted
heavenward, without either a conflict or a difficulty? or, are we
to expect a stiff, hard warfare to the end, with a certain hope
of victory through the perfection of our Leader&rsquo;s power,
but with all the accompaniments of a deadly struggle until the
victory is won and Satan bruised under our feet for ever?&nbsp; I
regard this question as one of the utmost importance, for if we
look for that which God has not promised, our very faith will
lead to disappointment; whereas if we do not look for that which
He has really promised, we shall clearly never rise to the high
standard of His Word.&nbsp; To this question then I purpose to
turn your thoughts this morning, and I pray God that the Holy
Spirit may teach us all, and lead us rightly to understand, and
truly to act on, His Word.</p>
<p>This text appears to throw great light on the subject, for in
the first clause the Psalmist actually pleads before God the
recognised fact of a past and present consecration.&nbsp; He does
not say, &lsquo;I wish to be Thine,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I hope to be
Thine,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I pray Thee to make me Thine,&rsquo; but
he says, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine,&rsquo; and no one could say
that unless he had already yielded himself to God.&nbsp; But it
is not consecration only that is expressed <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>when the
believer says, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine;&rsquo; for the
consecration of which I was speaking last Sunday is a human
act,&mdash;it is our own surrender of our own powers to God; and
when we look closely at anything we do we may well remember the
words of the prophet, &lsquo;How weak is thine
heart!&rsquo;&nbsp; If we can truly say in faith, &lsquo;Lord, I
am Thine,&rsquo; we must rely on something a great deal better
than our own consecration of ourselves.&nbsp; We belong to the
Lord Jesus by virtue of the eternal covenant to which He referred
when He said, &lsquo;My Father which gave them Me is greater than
all;&rsquo; we belong to Him because we have been made His own by
redemption, so as to be parts of the &lsquo;Church which He has
purchased with His own blood;&rsquo; we belong to Him because we
have been separated unto Him by the mighty power of the Holy
Ghost, and so been &lsquo;sanctified unto obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ;&rsquo; we belong to Him,
for we have been made His own children by adoption, so that He
speaks of us, saying, &lsquo;I and the children whom Thou hast
given Me;&rsquo; and we belong to Him, for we have been solemnly
signed and sealed unto Him in our baptism, and in our own persons
have deliberately ratified the <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>covenant.&nbsp; So that when we say,
&lsquo;Lord, I am Thine,&rsquo; we do not merely refer to some
one particular transaction of our own at some one particular
time, but we look at the whole counsel and covenant of
God,&mdash;at the great and perfect work of God the Father, God
the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,&mdash;before which any feeble
effort of our own minds is absolutely nothing; and, reviewing it
all, we kneel down, with our hearts full of praise, and wonder,
and say with the deepest thanksgiving, &lsquo;Lord, I am
Thine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that these words, while they include
personal consecration on our own part, express that which is
infinitely greater: namely, the great grace of God Himself in
redeeming us by the precious blood of the Lamb, and separating us
as a holy people unto Himself.&nbsp; And now follows the
question: When in this highest sense we can kneel down and really
say with truth, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine,&rsquo; what is to
follow?&nbsp; The words of the text supply us with a most
important answer; for they teach that one of the great results
will be believing prayer, and they show that when we are really
His, and when we know that we are His, we are not to rest content
with that sacred and unspeakable <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>privilege, but to kneel down afresh
and say, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine: save me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is clear from this passage that there was something which
David still wanted, although he was the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He
was safe, but he still prayed to be saved; he had been made the
Lord&rsquo;s own dear child, but he still prayed, &lsquo;Save
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let us consider, then, what he wanted, and what
he did; and may God the Holy Ghost so apply the passage to our
souls, that we may know the double blessing of being His and
being saved through His grace!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">What he wanted</span>; or, in
other words, what he prayed for when he prayed that he might be
saved.&nbsp; There appears to be no reference in the psalm to
temporal deliverance, so we need not consider the prayer as
referring to it.&nbsp; It was for spiritual gifts that he prayed,
and from spiritual difficulties that he desired to be
saved.&nbsp; And when we consider these spiritual gifts it is
very clear that it was not acceptance, or reconciliation, for
which he prayed, for his mind must have been quite at rest upon
that point when he said, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What he was longing for was personal holiness,&mdash;that <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>is, a
complete conformity to the perfect will of that holy God to whom
he belonged and whom he loved.&nbsp; You see this throughout the
psalm.&nbsp; He does not pray, &lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Receive me,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Blot out my
transgressions,&rsquo; as he does in some other psalms; but he
does pray again and again that God&rsquo;s statutes might be
written on his heart: &lsquo;Oh, that my ways were directed to
keep Thy statutes:&rsquo; &lsquo;Teach me Thy statutes;&rsquo;
&lsquo;Deal bountifully with Thy servant, that I may live and
keep Thy word;&rsquo; &lsquo;Quicken me after Thy
loving-kindness; so shall I keep the testimony of Thy
mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole psalm is full of such prayers, and
they show us perfectly clearly that the salvation for which he
prayed was the power for holiness from God.&nbsp; So the psalm
also teaches us what was the difficulty in the attainment of his
wish.&nbsp; There are some allusions to enemies, from which we
may infer that there were persons about him who hindered his
progress.&nbsp; But the psalm shows clearly that the real
difficulty lay in himself, and in the deadness of his own
heart.&nbsp; No less than nine times does he pray, &lsquo;Quicken
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And what did that prayer imply?&nbsp; Was it not
that he was conscious of a dead, cold state of heart, and was
longing for life and warmth?&nbsp; <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Had there been no element of
deadness in his soul, he would not have required to be quickened;
but there was that element of deadness, and he himself urged it
as a reason for his prayer, when he said (verse 25), &lsquo;My
soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken Thou me according to Thy
word.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the deep corruption of his human nature
which continued to cling to him, even when he was the
Lord&rsquo;s, against which he prayed when he said, &lsquo;Lord,
I am Thine: save me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now arises the most deeply important practical question:
Are we, as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, at the very time
that we can truly say &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine,&rsquo; to be
prepared to meet the same difficulty?&nbsp; In answer to that
question, I have not one moment&rsquo;s hesitation in replying
that we are.&nbsp; I have read and heard that original sin in
certain persons is &lsquo;destroyed,&rsquo; is &lsquo;dead,
though capable of revival;&rsquo; is &lsquo;rendered
inert,&rsquo; and is &lsquo;in suspense;&rsquo; but I do not
believe one word of it.&nbsp; It is far too large a subject for
me to attempt to discuss fully in one short sermon: I have not
time to give you more than two passages, but I hope they will be
sufficient.&nbsp; In Romans viii.,&mdash;that grand chapter, so
full of the grand tidings of safety, beginning with no <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>condemnation and ending with no separation,&mdash;the
chapter which some claim as descriptive of what they term
&lsquo;the higher life,&rsquo;&mdash;in the middle of that
chapter we find a description of the sons of God who are led by
the Spirit.&nbsp; Now observe carefully the effect of that
leading of God&rsquo;s children by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; We find
it in verse 13: &lsquo;If ye do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall live: for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are
the sons of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word rendered &lsquo;do
mortify&rsquo; means &lsquo;are habitually putting to
death&rsquo;
(&theta;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&epsilon;).&nbsp;
But if original sin were dead already, or inert, why should the
children of God, by the power of the Holy Ghost, be habitually
putting to death its deeds?&nbsp; The fact that its deeds are to
be habitually put to death is a perfectly clear proof that the
root of the evil is not dead already.</p>
<p>One passage more, and I have chosen it because I think it of
peculiar importance in its bearing on what is called the
&lsquo;higher life.&rsquo;&nbsp; You remember that wonderful
insight into heaven which St. Paul describes in 2 Cor. xii., and
you remember how it was followed up by the thorn in the
flesh,&mdash;&lsquo;the messenger of Satan,&rsquo; given
&lsquo;to buffet him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now why was it thus
followed?&nbsp; <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Why was this messenger of Satan let loose upon
God&rsquo;s chosen servant immediately after this wonderful
blessing?&nbsp; He himself tells us the reason: &lsquo;Lest I
should be exalted beyond measure.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other words, he
was in danger of pride of heart.&nbsp; He was caught up into the
third heaven, but he carried with him even there so much of the
old evil of his fallen nature that when he came down he was in
such danger of being puffed up with pride that it was an act of
mercy in God even to permit him to be buffeted by Satan&rsquo;s
messenger, in order to keep him in a humble spirit, depending
upon grace.&nbsp; Surely we learn the lesson that, whatever be
our spiritual attainments, and whatever God has taught us of His
mercy, we have still to strive as David did against the active
working of indwelling sin, and to pray as he did, &lsquo;Lord, I
am Thine: save me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We see then what the Psalmist <span
class="smcap">wanted</span>; let us consider next <span
class="smcap">what he did</span>.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; When he was conscious that his soul was cleaving to
the dust, he was not content to leave it there.&nbsp; He did not
say that it could not be helped, and so make it an excuse for
sin.&nbsp; He <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>did not do as some people do with reference to their
temper,&mdash;say they have the misfortune of a bad temper, and
therefore consider themselves not to be blamed when they break
out in a passion, or settle down in a sulky fit.&nbsp; He
resolutely, determinately, and prayerfully grappled with the
difficulty.&nbsp; He was conscious of sin, but he could not
endure the thought of it.&nbsp; He could say from the bottom of
his heart, &lsquo;I hate and abhor lying; but Thy law do I love
and it was because he loved the law, and hated the sin, that he
came before God with the cry, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine: save
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; So we may be perfectly sure that if a person be
really born of God, the knowledge of indwelling sin will never
lead him to settle down in the apathy of hopelessness; but will
arouse him, by the sense of danger, to watch, to pray, to trust,
to strive, to conquer, in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But while David was thus energetic in his struggle,
and allowed no compromise with sin, he was evidently brought to
the acknowledgment of his own helplessness.&nbsp; With reference
to the past he could say, &lsquo;I have sought Thy
precepts;&rsquo; and with reference to the present, <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>&lsquo;I
love Thy commandments above gold: yea, than much fine
gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; But notwithstanding all his painstaking, he
found he could not raise his own heart above the dust, and was
still obliged to acknowledge the truth of the words, &lsquo;No
man hath quickened his own soul.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus the words,
&lsquo;Lord, save me!&rsquo; implied that he had given up all
hope of saving himself; and when we offer the same prayer, there
is the same act of self-renunciation as well as faith.&nbsp; I do
not say that we shall give up the most diligent and devout
endeavours after holiness, for we shall &lsquo;press towards the
mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus;&rsquo; but that in the midst of it all we shall both know
and acknowledge our own utter helplessness; and thank God for
that passage in Rom. v. 6, in which we are taught that
&lsquo;when we were <i>yet</i> without strength, in due time
Christ died for the ungodly.&rsquo;&nbsp; I commend that
&lsquo;yet&rsquo; to the careful consideration of all those who
are painfully conscious of their own inability to rise.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But while this prayer implied self-renunciation as
well as trust, it implied on the other hand trust as well as
self-renunciation.&nbsp; When we pray, &lsquo;Lord, save
me,&rsquo; we clearly <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>recognise His saving power.&nbsp; We
know (as we are taught in Heb. vii. 25) that &lsquo;He is able to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him and therefore
we come to God by Him that we may be saved.&nbsp; The saving in
that sense is exactly the same as the saving in the text.&nbsp;
It is not the first acceptance of the repentant sinner seeking
salvation, but it is the habitual saving throughout the life; for
the point of the text is that it is continued to the uttermost,
or to the end.&nbsp; It is a saving carried on after the first
great saving act is complete.&nbsp; I am anxious to press this on
your attention, because I am inclined to think that it is the
secret of the fresh help which many persons appear to have lately
received.&nbsp; I cannot say I am sure of it; for the statements
on the subject are so confused, that it is almost impossible to
disentangle them.&nbsp; It is possible therefore that I may be
entirely mistaken.&nbsp; But, whether it is or not, you will see
in a moment the vast difference between knowing that there is a
Saviour able to save, and resting in a Saviour who is actually
and continually engaged in saving you; between being anxious to
obtain the help of a certain physician, and being under that

class="pagenum">p. 129</span>hanging on a wreck and seeing a
life-boat near you, and being in the life-boat, and, though still
beaten by the storm, safe in the strong arm of the
Deliverer.&nbsp; Now this is our position in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;
We are not seeking to reach the life-boat, for we are in it, as
David was when he said, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
storm is not over, the harbour is not yet reached; but the
harbour is in sight, and our Father is at the helm.&nbsp; David
clearly prayed to Him as to one who had already begun His saving
work, as you will clearly see if you compare the 88th and 93rd
verses.&nbsp; In the 88th he prays, &lsquo;Quicken me after Thy
loving-kindness;&rsquo; and in the 93rd he shows that the
quickening was already begun, for he says, &lsquo;I will never
forget Thy precepts, for with them Thou hast quickened
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will see in a moment what an enormous
difference this distinction must make in daily life.&nbsp; If you
are looking up to Him as one from whom you are only seeking help,
you may be perfectly sure of His sufficiency, but it will not
satisfy the anxieties of your soul: but if you are actually
enjoying His help, so that you can say, as the Psalmist did,
&lsquo;My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped,&rsquo; then you
may add, as he did, &lsquo;Therefore my <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>heart
greatly rejoiceth, and with my song will I praise
Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Look on Him then as one who is engaged in
bearing you home; acknowledge what He has done in the past, trust
Him for what He will do in the future, and meanwhile rest in what
He is doing now,&mdash;just as St. Paul did when, speaking of
temporal deliverance, he said (2 Cor. i. 10), &lsquo;Who
delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we
trust that He will yet deliver.&rsquo;&nbsp; That one verse
brings before us the past, present, and future,&mdash;the
&lsquo;yesterday, to-day, and for ever,&rsquo;&mdash;the Lord
Jesus a very present help, and a help to the end.&nbsp; He has
redeemed you by His own most precious blood, and saved you from
all condemnation of the law: that is done and perfected for
ever.&nbsp; He has sanctified, or separated, you in Christ Jesus,
to be a purchased possession unto God: that is done likewise, and
done for ever.&nbsp; He has begun a good work in you, and made
you new creatures in Christ Jesus: that, too, is done, thanks to
His mercy!&nbsp; He is now holding you in His hand, guiding you
by His counsel, helping you by His power, and giving you the
victory even over the indwelling sin which still lives, though He
will not let it reign, within your <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>heart.&nbsp; This is going on now:
so that now, even now, He is quickening you, and when you are
deeply and profoundly humbled for all that you have done and left
undone, and when, under the painful conviction of indwelling sin,
you are compelled to acknowledge that your &lsquo;soul cleaveth
unto the dust,&rsquo; you may still in happy, peaceful, loving
trust, look up to Him who is even now bearing you in His arm, and
say, &lsquo;Lord, I am Thine: save me.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>THE
HOLY NAME SANCTIFIED.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And He said unto them, When ye pray, say,
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy
name.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xi. 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are all in the habit of using
this prayer every day,&mdash;for I hope that there is not one
amongst us who presumes to think that he has reached a spiritual
life beyond it.&nbsp; We use it with the utmost
thankfulness,&mdash;for it expresses the deep and unceasing wants
of the human heart; and, as far as I myself am concerned, I do
not think that it occurs too often in our liturgy.&nbsp; This
clause may be called &lsquo;The child&rsquo;s first
prayer.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the first desire of the child of God,
poured forth morning by morning into his Father&rsquo;s
ear.&nbsp; But have you ever considered how it bears on the
subject of Sanctification, which we have been recently
considering?&nbsp; Are you aware that the two words, to
&lsquo;hallow&rsquo; and to &lsquo;sanctify,&rsquo; mean the same
thing, and may be <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>interchanged one with another, so that exactly the same
idea would have been expressed had the clause been rendered,
&lsquo;Sanctified be Thy name?&rsquo;&nbsp; But so it is: and
therefore in this prayer we pray every day of our lives that
God&rsquo;s own name may be &lsquo;sanctified.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now it will be clear in a moment to every one of you, that
when the expression is thus applied to God Himself, and to His
name, it must mean something very different to what it does when
it is applied to ourselves.&nbsp; It cannot mean separation unto
God, for it is applied to Him who from all eternity has been
essentially separate.&nbsp; Nor can it be used in the sense of
&lsquo;making holy,&rsquo; for perfect and unblemished holiness
is the very essence of His Godhead.&nbsp; What then does it
mean?&nbsp; It means that the holiness of His name should be
known and honoured; and that whenever His name is named, there
should be the recognition and exhibition of His holiness.&nbsp;
It is a prayer, in fact, that His holiness may be glorified, and
that throughout the world He may be obeyed and revered as a holy
God.</p>
<p>This sanctifying, or hallowing, of the name of God Himself
shall be our subject for this <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>morning.&nbsp; And may He Himself
grant that His name may be sanctified in this very sermon!&nbsp;
Let our prayer be, &lsquo;Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first point to which I would draw your attention is that
He is sanctified in His people.&nbsp; His power is manifest in
the world: His holiness in His Church.&nbsp; It is by the Church
that is to be known, even to principalities and powers in
heavenly places, the manifold wisdom of God.&nbsp; The Church of
God is gathered from a rebel world in order that God in it may
display His holiness, and so make proof of His character.&nbsp;
He manifests himself amongst His people, and this manifestation
is witnessed by the world.&nbsp; You see this very clearly in
such a passage as Ezek. xxxvi. 23: &lsquo;The heathen shall know
that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be
sanctified in you before their eyes.&rsquo;&nbsp; God would be so
sanctified in His people that the heathen should be persuaded of
His Godhead.&nbsp; So you read in Levit. x. 3: &lsquo;I will be
sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the people I
will be glorified.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now mark what a lesson there is
in this for ourselves.&nbsp; In one sense we are all come nigh to
God, for <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>we have all been baptized into His name.&nbsp; We all
meet in His house as His worshippers; and many of us delight in
the sacred privilege of drawing near to Him in His sacramental
feast.&nbsp; I hope it may be said of many in the reality of
their souls&rsquo; salvation, as it may certainly be said of all
in the externals of their Christianity,&mdash;that they are
&lsquo;a people nigh unto Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if so, He is to
be sanctified in us.&nbsp; We who draw nigh unto Him, are to be
like the glass reflecting His image: it is in us that His
character is to be exhibited, and His holiness made manifest
before the world.&nbsp; We are to be changed into His image, even
as by the Spirit of the Lord, so that in us ought to be seen that
image, and in us the holiness of His name should be exalted
amongst men.</p>
<p>But now follows the question,&mdash;In what way and by whom,
must His name be hallowed, or sanctified, in His people?&nbsp; In
answer to this we shall find, if we study Scripture, that it will
be sanctified by His people, and also by Himself.&nbsp; It will
be however sufficient for our present purpose if we confine our
attention to its sanctification by His people, as described in
these words of the prophet Isaiah: &lsquo;They shall <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>sanctify my
name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great question, therefore, for us to consider is, In what
way may we glorify God?&nbsp; And the answer is given in the
words of our Lord Himself, as written in John, xv. 8:
&lsquo;Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
fruit.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will observe that it is not merely by
feeling, or even by communion with God, but by fruit.&nbsp; I
know that joy and peace are amongst the first-fruits of the
Spirit, and God forbid that I should say one word that could
possibly be understood as spoken lightly of such a gift as
communion with God!&nbsp; It is the most sacred privilege that it
is possible for a ransomed spirit to enjoy, and nothing but the
finished ransom could ever admit us to it.&nbsp; But we must not
confound it with the fruit that springs from it, or suppose that
to enjoy communion is the same as to be holy.&nbsp; The sap is
essential to the life of the tree, but the sap is not the fruit,
and there is a great deal of sap in many trees where there is no
fruit at all.&nbsp; The fruit is something practical, something
contributed, and if it glorifies God, it will be visible to our
fellow-men.&nbsp; So our Lord said (Matt. v. 16), &lsquo;Let <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>your light
so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father which is in heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor must we confine it to a victory over sin.&nbsp; I
sometimes meet with books in which this victory appears to be
described as the sum and substance of holiness.&nbsp; Now I do
not doubt for one moment that it is a part of it; but it is only
a part: the negative side, and not the positive.&nbsp; It would
not satisfy your mind to be assured there were no thorns on your
roses, or no poisonous berries on your vines; you want flowers on
the rose, and grapes on the vine.&nbsp; I do not know that there
was any harm in the fig-tree that stood by the way-side from
Bethany: I never read that it yielded poison; but it bore no
fruit, and the Lord withered it.&nbsp; So it is that we stop
utterly short of the true character of Christian holiness if we
describe it simply as a victory over sin.&nbsp; Suppose that we
really had overcome, and that there had been such a conquest in
deed, in word, and in thought, that we should have no occasion
for the confession, &lsquo;We have done those things which we
ought not to have done;&rsquo; we might still be as fruitless as
the barren fig-tree, and have reason to throw ourselves, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>in the
deepest and most profound repentance, before His feet, and cry,
&lsquo;We have left undone those things which we ought to have
done.&rsquo;&nbsp; True fruit is positive service: something that
pervades our life.&nbsp; Thus of the fruits of the Spirit, as
described in Gal. v. 22,&mdash;&lsquo;Love, joy, peace,
long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance,&rsquo;&mdash;by far the greater number relate to our
practical conduct amongst our fellow-men.&nbsp; In the account of
heavenly wisdom given by St. James they are all of the same
character: &lsquo;The wisdom that is from above is first pure,
then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy
and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace of them that make peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>True fruit again is something yielded up to God.&nbsp; When a
missionary gives up home, and life itself for the Gospel, that is
fruit.&nbsp; When the Sunday-school teacher devotes the day of
rest to labour for God, that is fruit.&nbsp; When people bring
freely of their substance, and throw large gifts into the
treasury of God, that is fruit.&nbsp; When people in family life,
heads of families, servants, young people, lay themselves out to
make all <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>happy around them, and by their loving, gentle conduct,
commend the Gospel to all with whom they are brought in contact,
that is fruit.&nbsp; It may not be the fruit of the hot-house,
enjoyed only by the rich; or like some of those fruits which look
so beautiful aloft on our orchard trees, that all admire: for we
must remember that some of our best fruits grow in the cottage
gardens, close to the ground.&nbsp; So God is often best
glorified by the holy, humble, and self-denying zeal of the
humble believer, keeping alow by the ground, and there, in humble
life, &lsquo;adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour in all
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But you will observe in our Lord&rsquo;s words, that it is not
merely by fruit, but by much fruit, that God is glorified.&nbsp;
All trees of the same kind are not equally fruitful, nor are all
believers; thus it by no means follows that all believers glorify
God, or that those who do so, do so equally.&nbsp; Our Lord
Himself describes four degrees in His parable of the sower.&nbsp;
First, there are those who are choked by the cares, and
pleasures, and riches, of this life, and bring no fruit to
perfection.&nbsp; The plant is not altogether dead, and there may
be a little fruit <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>formed; but there is none ripened, nothing worth
having, nothing that glorifies God.&nbsp; I fear there is a
terrible number of those choked-up Christians in the Church of
God.&nbsp; Then where there is real fruitfulness, there are
different degrees.&nbsp; Some yield their thirty, some their
sixty, and some their hundred-fold.&nbsp; How earnest ought we to
be that every one may be what I may term, hundred-fold
Christians,&mdash;people abounding in the fruits of the Spirit,
spending and being spent for God!</p>
<p>And why not?&nbsp; The sacred privilege of glorifying God does
not belong to some peculiar class of Christians,&mdash;to persons
who have been suddenly lifted into what they term &lsquo;the
higher life,&rsquo;&mdash;but to all those who are abiding in
Christ Jesus, and have Him abiding in them; for He says,
&lsquo;He that abideth in Me, and I in him; the same bringeth
forth much fruit.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may have reason therefore to
be most deeply humbled under the conviction of indwelling sin,
and to be most heartily grieved for the mixed thoughts and
motives that have intruded themselves into the holiest acts of
your whole lives; you may be utterly displeased with yourselves
for the utter poverty of your best services; you <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>may be so
convinced of what you consider the peculiar difficulties of your
own character, that you may think it quite impossible that you
yourselves should ever rise to a high standard of Christian
holiness: but there is a power in the Lord Jesus so to raise you
above your difficulties that you may not only be saved, but
actually raised to such a standard that, though you may not know
it, you may bring glory to His name.&nbsp; Nothing could be more
hopelessly dead than Aaron&rsquo;s rod, but in one night it
&lsquo;budded and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and
yielded fruit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing could be more hopeless than
the case of David when he was in the horrible pit and the miry
clay; but the Lord &lsquo;set his feet on a rock and established
his goings, and put a new song into his mouth, even praise unto
his God,&rsquo; and the result was that God was glorified in his
deliverance; for he adds, &lsquo;Many shall see it and fear, and
shall trust in the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you may say that you are
dead, that you cannot rise, that there is no hope,&mdash;and
there is no hope in your own efforts at
self-quickening,&mdash;but He who raised the dead to life can so
triumph even over your deadness as to bring out of your dead
heart such an <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>abundance of beautiful fruit, through the power of His
own grace, that He Himself may be pleased with your loving and
faithful service.&nbsp; Nay, more!&nbsp; Though you may never be
able to see it, and though you may to the last be humbled to the
dust for your shortcomings, He may still fulfil in you, and
towards you, the prayer which St. Paul prayed for the
Thessalonians: &lsquo;That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may
be glorified in you and ye in Him, according to the grace of our
God and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aim then at the highest possible standard.&nbsp; Never settle
down contented with anything that falls short of it.&nbsp; Never
consider that your case is too difficult for the Lord, the
Deliverer, but trust Him so to abide in you with power, that His
own words may be fulfilled: &lsquo;Herein is my Father glorified,
that ye bear much fruit.&rsquo;</p>

143</span>EXPOSITORY NOTES.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Note</span> A.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Romans</span>, <span class="smcap">vii</span>.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">believe</span> that a great deal of the
difficulty felt respecting the seventh chapter of the Epistle to
the Romans, arises from a mistaken idea that the different
chapters are descriptive of consecutive periods of the Christian
life.&nbsp; Persons are supposed to be justified in the fifth,
brought to a new life in the sixth, and to be living in perfect
peace in the eighth, and thus the conflict of the seventh is
thought to be out of place.&nbsp; But surely there is no such
consecutiveness to be found in the passage.</p>
<p>Both the sixth and seventh chapters are an answer to the
question in the first verse of the sixth, &lsquo;Shall we
continue in sin?&rsquo;&nbsp; And this answer is founded on the
principle that we must not do so, because such conduct would be
inconsistent with the great change that has taken place in
us.&nbsp; This change is then described under three figures.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>(1.)&nbsp; A death unto sin through the death of our
Lord Jesus Christ. (Ch. vi. 3&ndash;15.)</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; A change of service. (Ch. vi. 16&ndash;23.)</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; A release from the law, as a woman is loosed from
the law of her husband when he dies (Ch. vii. 1&ndash;6); the
result of which is that, therefore, we are now free from
condemnation, etc. (Ch. viii. 1).&nbsp; The
&lsquo;therefore&rsquo; of this verse depends on the deliverance
described in ch. vii. 6, and the intermediate passage (ver.
7&ndash;25) is a parenthesis.&nbsp; It is in the parenthesis that
the difficulty is supposed to lie; and by the place which that
parenthesis occupies in the argument that it must be
explained.</p>
<p>In his argument the Apostle had connected sin with the law,
which of course suggested the idea that the law was sinful; an
idea which would have been shocking to Jewish minds, and was
entirely contrary to his own.&nbsp; In accordance, therefore,
with his usual style, he broke off from the direct line of his
argument, in order to protect the truth against any such
objection; and thus introduced the parenthesis.</p>
<p>This consists of two questions, with their respective
answers.</p>
<p>The first is in the seventh verse: &lsquo;What shall we say
then?&nbsp; Is the law sin?&nbsp; God forbid.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
he answers by a reference to his own history, and by showing that
the law, so far from being sin, had served to discover and
develope it; and by doing so had slain him. (Ver.
7&ndash;12.)&nbsp; Thus far the passage is clearly <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>historical,
and the &lsquo;I&rsquo; is his own historical self, as I believe
it to be throughout.</p>
<p>But this answer suggested a further difficulty: viz., that a
good thing had been the means of slaying him; and this led to the
second question (ver. 13): &lsquo;Was then that which is good
made death unto me?&nbsp; God forbid.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this the
answer was that the fault was not in the law, but in himself; for
even in his new condition, when he heartily loved the law, the
old nature of the flesh was still so powerful that he could not
fulfil it as he would. (Ver. 14&ndash;24.)</p>
<p>This explains the strong language of the fourteenth
verse,&mdash;&lsquo;I am carnal, sold under
sin,&rsquo;&mdash;which people find it difficult to reconcile
with the account of complete deliverance in the sixth verse.</p>
<p>For my own part I have no difficulty, for</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The explanation is suggested by the account he
gives of the &lsquo;me&rsquo; in the eighteenth verse.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In me, <i>that is</i>, <i>in my flesh</i>, dwelleth no
good thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is clear that he is speaking there of
his fallen human nature; and it is not unreasonable to believe
that the explanation there given covers the fourteenth verse as
well.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; This is the only meaning that the words can bear in
the context.&nbsp; He is showing that his death under the law was
not the fault of the law, but of his own nature.&nbsp; And,
therefore, he says, &lsquo;The law is spiritual, but I am&rsquo;
(by nature, that is) &lsquo;carnal, sold under sin.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He does not contradict his own words in <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>ch. vi. 11,
where he directs his readers to &lsquo;reckon themselves alive
unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord,&rsquo; for he is not
speaking of his position in Christ Jesus, but asserting that by
nature he was carnal; so that the law was not to blame for having
been made death unto him.&nbsp; There is no difficulty in the use
of the present tense if we bear in mind that the old nature is
not eradicated by the new birth.&nbsp; He, so far as his nature
was concerned, was as bad as ever to the last day of his
life.</p>
<p>The remainder of the parenthesis is a proof of this corruption
of his nature derived from his present experience.&nbsp; And the
exclamation of the twenty-fourth verse is the cry of a holy man
who, being regenerate, loved the law, and longed to be set free
from that power of a fallen nature which kept him back from its
complete fulfilment.&nbsp; He had been delivered from the law as
a condemning power; but he delighted in it as a rule of life, and
longed to be free from his evil nature, that so he might obey it
without impediment.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Note</span> B.&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">John</span>, <span class="smcap">iii</span>.
6.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth
not</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> words, if detached from their
context and from the remainder of the Epistle, apparently teach
the absolute and perfect sinlessness of all those who abide in
the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And if the words, &lsquo;sinneth <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>not,&rsquo;
describe an entire freedom from all sin, they clearly do so.</p>
<p>But this cannot possibly be their meaning; for if it were,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The remainder of the verse would teach us that if
any person should ever sin in thought, word, or deed, he would be
thereby proved never to have seen or known Christ.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He that sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known
Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; In the same manner the eighth and ninth verses
would teach us that if any person ever did wrong in any way
whatever, he would be of the devil, and not born of God.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He that committeth sin is of the devil.&rsquo; (Ver.
8.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
sin.&rsquo; (Ver. 9.)</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; This passage would be in direct contradiction to
the first chapter, in the seventh verse of which those who are
walking in the light are described as being cleansed from sin; in
the eighth, as having sin; in the ninth, as confessing it, and
being forgiven; and in the tenth, as having sinned.</p>
<p>Some other meaning, therefore, must be sought for the
expression, &lsquo;sinneth not.&rsquo;&nbsp; What this meaning is
may be gathered from the great object of the Epistle: which was
to correct the leading heresies of the day. (See ch. ii.
26.)&nbsp; Of these heresies one of the most prominent was that
of the Gnostics, who taught that if a man had the knowledge, or
the light, he might live as he pleased in practical life.&nbsp;
Against that corrupt <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>notion this passage is directed; and
its great object is to show that if there be the new birth, or a
union with the Lord Jesus, there is certain to be a practical
change of life and character.&nbsp; That this is the meaning is
plain from the context.&nbsp; It is there proved that he is
speaking of practical and habitual religion.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Of Practical Religion</span>.</p>
<p>In the seventh verse he shows that all true religion is
practical: &lsquo;He that <i>doeth</i> righteousness is
righteous, even as He is righteous.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our Blessed Lord
was practically righteous, so His people will be the same.</p>
<p>In the eighth verse he shows that the practice of sin is of
the Devil: &lsquo;He that <i>committeth</i> sin is of the
Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In ver. 5&ndash;8 he teaches that to destroy the works of the
Devil was the great object of the manifestation of our Blessed
Redeemer: &lsquo;For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,
that He might destroy the <i>works</i> of the Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the tenth verse he asserts that this practical
righteousness is the distinguishing test between the children of
God and the children of the Devil.&nbsp; It was clearly such
conduct as was visible to other men, or the distinction would not
have been manifest.&nbsp; &lsquo;In this the children of God are
manifest, and the children of the Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Of Habitual Religion</span>.</p>
<p>The present tense, indicating a continued habit, is <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>employed
throughout the passage.&nbsp; So the word sometimes rendered
&lsquo;committeth,&rsquo; and sometimes &lsquo;doeth,&rsquo; is
used to express the habit.&nbsp; This may be seen from the use of
it in these words of our Blessed Saviour (John, ix. 19):
&lsquo;None of you keepeth the law.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we adopt the
rendering of that verse, and substitute &lsquo;keepeth&rsquo; for
&lsquo;committeth&rsquo; in this passage there will be very
little difficulty in understanding the meaning of the
Apostle.&nbsp; The fourth verse would then be, &lsquo;He that
keepeth sin transgresseth also the law;&rsquo; and the eighth,
&lsquo;He that keepeth sin is of the Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole passage teaches us the great importance of being
most earnest in urging the necessity of a practically consistent
life on the children of God, and in showing that there must be a
change in heart, in principle, and in habitual practice, whenever
a person is born of God; but it has no reference whatever to the
secret heart-struggles of the true believer in his earnest
conflict with indwelling sin.&nbsp; They are not the subject of
the passage.&nbsp; There are other Scriptures which speak of
them, but this refers to practical and habitual conduct.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Note</span> C.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">On the Word</span> &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Perfect</span>.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The word &tau;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
is of so frequent occurrence in Scripture that it requires our
careful study.</p>
<p>Its original sense is &lsquo;complete,&rsquo; and the
corresponding <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>verb
&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&#8057;&omega; is to
complete, or finish.&nbsp; The derived senses will vary with the
subjects to which it applied.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; In the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, it
stands for sincere, upright, undivided in heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations,
and Noah walked with God.&rsquo; (Gen. vi. 9.)</p>
<p>Amaziah had a great deal of religion about him, but he was
inconsistent; and, therefore, it says of him, &lsquo;He did that
which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect
heart.&rsquo; (2 Chron. xxv. 2.)</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; In Matt. v. 48, it means complete, or
comprehensive, as opposed to being limited and partial.</p>
<p>Our Lord is exhorting His disciples to love their enemies as
well as their friends (verses 43, 44); and says, &lsquo;That ye
may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for He
maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then goes on to show that there is no value in merely
partial love (46, 47); and concludes with the words, &lsquo;Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is, like Him; show your love to your
opponents as well as to your brethren.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; In Heb. v. 14, it is used of those who are
&lsquo;of full age,&rsquo; or complete in their growth, and
therefore capable of strong meat; as contrasted with those who <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>are babes,
and therefore fed on milk.&nbsp; It is the same in Eph. iv. 13,
14; and 1 Cor. xiv. 20.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; In 1 Cor. ii. 6, it means &lsquo;fully
initiated.&rsquo;&nbsp; A mystery was something not known to the
world, but revealed to those who were initiated, and those who
were initiated were called
&tau;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&iota;.&nbsp; So here
St. Paul says, &lsquo;We speak wisdom amongst them that are
perfect,&rsquo; or the initiated: &lsquo;yet not the wisdom of
this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our
glory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am not sure whether Phil. iii. 15, expresses full
initiation, or full manhood.&nbsp; I am inclined to think that it
means initiation, as the verse speaks of a yet further
manifestation of God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us therefore,
as many as be perfect,&rsquo; or initiated, &lsquo;be thus
minded: and if in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even this unto you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At all events it is perfectly clear that it does not mean
personal perfection, for St. Paul says, verse 12, &lsquo;Not as
though I had already attained, either were already
perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; In Heb. x. 1, it means the complete removal of the
guilt of sin through the sprinkling of blood.&nbsp; The law by
its sacrifices could never &lsquo;make the comers thereunto
perfect.&rsquo;&nbsp; If they could have done so those sacrifices
would have ceased to be offered, &lsquo;because that the
worshippers once purged should <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>have had no more conscience of
sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; It should be observed that the passage is not
speaking of the purifying of the heart, but of the purging of the
conscience.&nbsp; To purify the heart, is to render it so pure
that it will love only pure things; to purge the conscience is to
remove from it the guilt of which it is conscious in consequence
of the impurity of the heart.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, this
purifying is complete through the offering of the Lord Jesus
Christ once for all; and the comers thereunto are through it
perfect before God!</p>
<p>I know of no passage in which the word is applied to a present
sinlessness, or a present perfect purifying of the heart.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Note</span> D.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Temptation</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Heb</span>. <span class="smcap">iv</span>. 15.</h3>
<p>It is said of our Blessed Saviour, &lsquo;For we have not an
High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it has been argued that because He
was tempted, yet without sin, therefore there is no sin in
temptation.&nbsp; I can scarcely imagine a more dangerous
fallacy.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word, &lsquo;to tempt,&rsquo; is to test,
or to try.&nbsp; So &lsquo;God tempted Abraham,&rsquo; or put him
to the test. (Gen. xxii. 1.)&nbsp; Thus our Lord was in all
points tried, or tested, like as we are: that is, by the sinless
infirmities of the body; by the surrounding <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>circumstances of life; by the influence of man, both
friends and foes; by the Devil; and even, we may reverently say
it, by God Himself, when He called Him to bear a burden much more
heavy than that laid on Abraham.&nbsp; But He was never tempted
by any corruption in His own heart or nature, for if He had been
He would not have been &lsquo;without sin,&rsquo; even though He
had resisted it.&nbsp; There was clearly no sin in being thus
tested, nor did He ever sin in yielding.</p>
<p>Temptation to evil must always be considered in its origin, as
well as in its effect.&nbsp; In daily life we think worse of the
author of the temptation than of the victim.&nbsp; But no
temptation originated in the heart of our blessed Redeemer.&nbsp;
According to this text He was &lsquo;without sin;&rsquo; for not
only did He never yield, but there was no evil in His heart in
which sin could originate.&nbsp; We are not, therefore, justified
in quoting the temptation of our sinless Saviour, that came upon
Him from without, as proving that there is no sin in those
temptations which arise out of the evil of our own hearts.&nbsp;
There is certainly sin in such temptation as that described by
our Lord Himself, when He said, &lsquo;Out of the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murders,&rsquo; etc., (Matt. xv. 19); and in that
condemned by St. James in the words, &lsquo;Every man is tempted
when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.&rsquo;
(James, i. 14.)&nbsp; In no such cases are we covered by our
Lord&rsquo;s example; for, even if we are preserved from falling,
the temptation itself is sin, and the result of sin within the
soul.</p>

154</span>DOCTRINAL NOTES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first edition of these
Sermons I added a short review of two books that have lately
excited some attention in the Church.&nbsp; I understand that
their author is himself so much dissatisfied with them, that he
has been for some time past engaged in re-writing them.&nbsp; It
is, therefore, not worth my while to republish my review, and,
instead of it, I have added the following Notes.</p>
<p>Some of them are of a controversial character; but my object
is to promote agreement rather than controversy.&nbsp; Several
excellent persons, both clergymen and laymen, have lately
experienced a remarkable answer to their prayers for an increase
of faith, and in consequence of the peculiarities of the channel
through which the answer has been given, they have been supposed
to have deviated from old paths, and to have embraced new
opinions at variance with the Word of God.&nbsp; I fear that this
may be the case in some instances, though I hope it is not so to
any great extent, for I find that many of them have never <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>read the
books to which some of us have thought it our duty to object, and
are as earnest for the old truths as ourselves.&nbsp; I have
therefore drawn up these Notes, embodying what I believe to be
the teaching of Scripture, in the hope that they may prove a
basis of union amongst those who are of one heart and one mind in
their common desire to exalt the name of their most blessed
Saviour.</p>
<p>The texts quoted must be regarded as only specimens, and not
supposed to contain the whole teaching of Scripture on the
subject.</p>
<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES.</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp; The only standard of holiness recognised in Scripture
is the perfect character and will of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 Peter, i. 15, 16; Rom. xii. 2.</p>
<p class="gutindent">There is no allusion in the Word of God to
any lower standard of any kind whatever.&nbsp; We are never
taught there that &lsquo;We are not called to walk by the rule of
angels, who excel, in strength,&rsquo; or that &lsquo;our
standard is not that which it will be in our glorified
bodies.&rsquo;&nbsp; According to Scripture, our rule is exactly
the same as that of angels: our standard is exactly the same as
it will be after the resurrection: and our constant prayer is,
&lsquo;Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is not the object <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of the Gospel to lower God&rsquo;s
standard to man&rsquo;s level, but in, and through, the Lord
Jesus Christ, to raise us to His standard, and at length present
us as faultless before His throne.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Personal holiness is the work of God.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Of God the Father.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Jer. xxxi. 33; John, xvii. 17.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Of God the Son.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Matt. i. 21; 1 Cor. i. 30.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Of God the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Acts, xv. 9; 2 Cor. iii. 18.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is the action of the believer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Heb. xii. 1; 1 John, iii. 3.</p>
<p class="gutindent">I have seen God&rsquo;s work in holiness
described as the same as God&rsquo;s work in the pardon of
sin.&nbsp; But there is this essential difference: Forgiveness is
an act of God in His own mind alone; holiness is a work of God in
the mind of man, controlling and directing all the activities of
the mind.&nbsp; Forgiveness is, therefore, altogether external to
man, and must be received in trust alone; but holiness is a power
and principle of human action, and therefore is developed in
human activities.&nbsp; The distinction may be illustrated by
repentance and forgiveness.&nbsp; Both are the gifts of our
exalted Saviour. (Acts, v. 31.)&nbsp; But God forgives, and man
repents.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>4.&nbsp; It commences with a new creation in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">2 Cor. v. 17; Eph. ii. 10.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It is the result of acceptance with God, and of the
realization of His mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 John, iii. 2, 3; Rom. xii. 1.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The principle which God employs to produce it is
faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Acts, xv. 9; 1 John, v. 4.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The instrument which He employs to produce it is the
truth as revealed in His own Word.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">John, xvii. 17.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The means by which it will be finally perfected will
be the full view of Christ Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 John, iii. 2.</p>
<h3>PRACTICAL RESULTS.</h3>
<p>If there is any difference on the subject of Personal Holiness
amongst those who hold the great principles of the Gospel, it is
not likely to appear so much in General Principles as in their
practical application to present life.&nbsp; It is, therefore,
clearly important to ascertain what should be the extent, and
what the limits, of the Believer&rsquo;s expectation.&nbsp; If we
do not expect all that He has promised, we cannot hope to rise to
His standard; and if, on the other hand, we expect what He has
not promised, we shall involve ourselves in either disappointment
or delusion.&nbsp; It is well, therefore, to consider from the
Word of God what we are <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>taught to expect, and what we are
not taught to expect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">WE ARE TAUGHT&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That when we are created in Christ Jesus old things
will pass away, and all things become new.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">2 Cor. v. 17, 18.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the Holy Spirit will dwell in our hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">John, xiv. 17.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That He will purify them.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Acts, xv. 9.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That we shall love the Lord Jesus Christ, and
acknowledge our love.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">2 Cor. v. 14; 1 John, iv. 19.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That we shall love the law of God, and delight in
it</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ps. cxix. 97; Rom. vii. 22.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That we shall be set free from the dominion of
sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Rom. vi. 14.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; That we shall overcome external temptation.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 John, v. 4, 5.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; That we shall habitually live righteously in
practical conduct.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Tit. ii. 12; 1 John, iii.
4&ndash;10.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; That we shall be continually growing in grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">2 Pet. iii. 18.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; That in this present life, though we fail to fulfil
God&rsquo;s perfect law, we may have the joy of <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>pleasing
God, and of actually bringing glory to His name.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">John, xv. 8; Col. i. 10; Heb. xiii.
16.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">WE ARE NOT TAUGHT&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the most eminent believers will be sinless.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 John, i. 7&ndash;10.</p>
<p class="gutindent">From that passage we learn that those who
are walking in the light, as He is in the light,&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">(1)&nbsp; Are continuously being cleansed
from sin (ver. 7).</p>
<p class="gutindent">(2)&nbsp; &lsquo;Have sin&rsquo; (ver. 8),
&lsquo;and have sinned&rsquo; (ver. 10).</p>
<p class="gutindent">(3)&nbsp; &lsquo;Have sin to confess, for
which they need forgiveness&rsquo; (ver. 9).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That original sin will ever in this present life be
either &lsquo;destroyed,&rsquo; &lsquo;dead,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rendered inert.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Rom. vi. 12.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The words, &lsquo;Let not sin reign in your
mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof,&rsquo;
are addressed to those who are to &lsquo;reckon themselves dead
unto sin and alive unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is clear, therefore,
that sin was still alive in them, or else it would have been
quite needless to exhort them not to let it reign, and not to
obey its lusts.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Compare also Rom. viii. 13; Col.
iii. 5.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>3.&nbsp; That sin is not sin till we discern it.&nbsp;
So that &lsquo;to-morrow I may discern evil in things in which
to-day I am living without condemnation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sin is the
transgression of the law, and what will be wrong to-morrow is
wrong to-day, whatever we may think of it.&nbsp; If the
conscience is so deadened, or seared, or perverted, that it does
not perceive sin, that deadness of conscience does not take away
the sinfulness of sin, but only adds the sin of not feeling sin
to the sin of committing it.&nbsp; The insensibility of a
deadened conscience amongst those who have received the Gospel
must never be confounded with the ignorance of those who never
heard it</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That believers attain to &lsquo;perfection up to the
measure of to-day&rsquo;s consciousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; As nothing
of the kind is found in Scripture, it is difficult to understand
exactly what the expression means.&nbsp; But if it mean that
believers are kept so holy that there is nothing in either their
hearts or lives which their own conscience condemns, the
statement is directly opposed to such passages as Heb. ix. 14, x.
2, &amp;c., which show that one great purpose of the precious
blood of Christ is to provide a continuous purging of the
conscience.&nbsp; If there is never anything on the conscience
which requires purging I cannot see that we have any need for the
purging blood.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>5.&nbsp; That we are to be assured of the existence of
our personal holiness through faith, as we are of our
justification.&nbsp; Faith is the evidence of things not seen,
and, therefore, the only direct evidence of our justification:
but personal holiness is within sight of conscience, and it would
be an abuse of faith to reckon ourselves holy when conscience
shows us that we are not really so.&nbsp; We believe ourselves to
be accounted righteous, though we know that we are really guilty;
but we must not believe ourselves to be actually holy when our
own conscience condemns us of sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1 John, iii. 19&ndash;24.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That our believing reception of the promise of
holiness from the Lord Jesus will supersede prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, 36.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; That our trust in the Lord Jesus for holiness will
supersede personal exertion and the diligent use of the means of
grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Acts, xxiv. 16; 1 Cor. ix. 27; Jude,
21, 24.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; That there is a higher life distinct from that of
which we are made partakers when first brought into union with
the &lsquo;Lord Jesus Christ,&rsquo; into which we may enter by a
definite act of entire consecration.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">No Scripture on this subject.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>9.&nbsp; That entire consecration is the means whereby
we are to attain to union with the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The
consecration of Scripture follows that union, and does not
precede it.&nbsp; The Christians at Rome were first
&lsquo;baptized into Jesus Christ,&rsquo; and afterwards, when
they were &lsquo;alive from the dead,&rsquo; were exhorted to
&lsquo;yield themselves to God.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Rom. vi. 3, 13.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the enjoyment of that blessed union
is marred and hindered by any reserve within the soul.&nbsp; But
if we are not to rest in it until we are satisfied that our
consecration is entire, I see not, for my part, how the heart can
ever be at rest unless the conscience is lulled to sleep by
shallow and superficial views of sin.&nbsp; All who look at the
self-consecration of our most blessed Saviour must be convinced
that their own consecration, whatever it is, falls utterly short
of such a standard; and if we are to wait for the enjoyment of
our union with Him until our consecration is entire, or, in other
words, till it is equal to His, that enjoyment seems to be placed
at an infinite distance from our reach.&nbsp; Surely the teaching
of Scripture is that we are admitted to the union as we are,
through His free grace; and then, because we live in Him, we
&lsquo;live not unto ourselves, but unto Him that died for us and
rose again.&rsquo;</p>

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
